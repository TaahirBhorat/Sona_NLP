"1",2023,"Ramaphosa","Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula,  Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Mr Amos Masondo,  Deputy President David Mabuza,  The Executive Mayor of the City of Cape Town, Mr Geordin Hill-Lewis,  Former President Thabo Mbeki,   Former Deputy President Baleka Mbete,  President of the Pan African Parliament, The Right Honourable Chief Fortune Charumbira,  Chief Justice Raymond Zondo and Members of the Judiciary,  Heads of Institutions Supporting Democracy,  Deputy President of the governing party, Mr Paul Mashatile and leaders of all parties,  Members of Parliament,  Fellow South Africans,      It is a great honour to stand before you this evening to present the State of the Nation.     "
"2",2023,"Ramaphosa","For we are a nation defined not by the oceans and rivers that form the boundaries of our land.     "
"3",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are not defined by the minerals under our earth or the spectacular landscape above it. "
"4",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are not even defined by the languages we speak or the songs we sing or the work we do.     "
"5",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are, at our most essential, a nation defined by hope and resilience.     "
"6",2023,"Ramaphosa","It was hope that sustained our struggle for freedom, and it is hope that swells our sails as we steer our country out of turbulent waters to calmer seas.     "
"7",2023,"Ramaphosa","Even in these trying times, it is hope that sustains us and fuels our determination to overcome even the greatest of difficulties.     "
"8",2023,"Ramaphosa","Just three years ago, our country was devastated by the worst global pandemic in living memory. "
"9",2023,"Ramaphosa","Thousands of lives were lost, companies closed, jobs were lost.     "
"10",2023,"Ramaphosa","COVID-19 did not browbeat us into submission or disillusionment.    "
"11",2023,"Ramaphosa","Working together, we overcame that crisis, and we have started to recover.     "
"12",2023,"Ramaphosa","Today our economy is larger than it was before the pandemic.    "
"13",2023,"Ramaphosa","Between the third quarters of 2021 and 2022, around one and a half million new jobs were created in our economy.      "
"14",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential Employment Stimulus has provided work and livelihood opportunities to more than one million people.     "
"15",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, our matriculants defied the effects of the pandemic to achieve a pass rate of 80% and we congratulate them for that great achievement.    "
"16",2023,"Ramaphosa","We see this spirit of determination in our artists, musicians, actors, authors and sportsmen and women, who are making waves at home, on the continent and beyond our shores.     "
"17",2023,"Ramaphosa","Banyana Banyana made us proud when they won the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations to become the champions of Africa.     "
"18",2023,"Ramaphosa","Zakes Bantwini, Nomcebo Zikode and Wouter Kellerman have made us proud at the Grammy Awards for their collaboration, Bayethe.     "
"19",2023,"Ramaphosa","What we have achieved as a nation over the past year, despite our challenges, remind us that the promise of South Africa is alive.      "
"20",2023,"Ramaphosa","The progress we have seen should give us courage as we look to a better future.     "
"21",2023,"Ramaphosa","And yet, I address you this evening, in homes across the country, many people are suffering, many are worried, many are uncertain and many are without hope.     "
"22",2023,"Ramaphosa","But of this I am certain. "
"23",2023,"Ramaphosa","Whatever the difficulties of the moment, whatever crises we face, we will rise to meet them together and, together, we will overcome them.     "
"24",2023,"Ramaphosa","This, we will be able to do if we work together and leave no one behind.    "
"25",2023,"Ramaphosa","We gather here at a time of crisis.     "
"26",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our country has, for many months, endured a debilitating electricity shortage that has caused immense damage to our economy.      "
"27",2023,"Ramaphosa","And for two years before that, our society was devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic that caused great loss of life and much hardship.     "
"28",2023,"Ramaphosa","The pandemic worsened a situation of deep unemployment, as the country lost two million jobs. "
"29",2023,"Ramaphosa","The pandemic negatively affected livelihoods and increased poverty.      "
"30",2023,"Ramaphosa","In July 2021, we experienced the worst public violence and destruction in the history of our democracy, causing over 300 deaths.     "
"31",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, parts of the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and North West were struck by catastrophic flooding that caused extensive loss of life, the destruction of homes and damage to infrastructure.     "
"32",2023,"Ramaphosa","And now, persistent load-shedding is impeding our recovery from the effects of these events.      "
"33",2023,"Ramaphosa","We know that without a reliable supply of electricity, businesses cannot grow, assembly lines cannot run, crops cannot be irrigated and basic services are interrupted.     "
"34",2023,"Ramaphosa","Load-shedding means that households and supermarkets are unable to keep food fresh, water supply is often disrupted, traffic lights do not work and streets are not lit at night.     "
"35",2023,"Ramaphosa","Without a reliable supply of electricity, our efforts to grow an inclusive economy that creates jobs and reduces poverty will not succeed.      "
"36",2023,"Ramaphosa","Therefore, as we outline our agenda for the year ahead, our most immediate task is to dramatically reduce the severity of load-shedding in the coming months and ultimately end load-shedding altogether.      "
"37",2023,"Ramaphosa","Under these conditions, we cannot proceed as we usually would.      "
"38",2023,"Ramaphosa","The people of South Africa want action, they want solutions and they want government to work for them.      "
"39",2023,"Ramaphosa","They simply want to know when a problem like load-shedding will be brought to an end.     "
"40",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are, therefore, focused on those actions that will make a meaningful difference now, that will enable real progress within the next year and that will lay a foundation for a sustained recovery into the future.      "
"41",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are not presenting new plans, nor are we outlining here the full programme of government.     "
"42",2023,"Ramaphosa","Rather we are concentrating on those issues that concern South Africans the most:      Load-shedding.      "
"43",2023,"Ramaphosa","Unemployment.      "
"44",2023,"Ramaphosa","Poverty and the rising cost of living.      "
"45",2023,"Ramaphosa","Crime and corruption.      "
"46",2023,"Ramaphosa","There are no easy solutions to any of these challenges.      "
"47",2023,"Ramaphosa","Yet we have the strength, the means and the wherewithal to overcome them.     "
"48",2023,"Ramaphosa","If we work together and act boldly and decisively, leaving no one behind, we will be able to resolve our challenges.      "
"49",2023,"Ramaphosa","This State of the Nation Address (SoNA) is about seeing hope where there is despair.      "
"50",2023,"Ramaphosa","It is about showing a way out of these crises.      "
"51",2023,"Ramaphosa","This evening, we will give an account of our progress in implementing the commitments we made in last year’s SoNA.     "
"52",2023,"Ramaphosa","Over the course of the last year, we have laid a firm foundation based on the commitments we made for faster growth through our investment drive, economic reforms, public employment programmes and an expanding infrastructure programme.      "
"53",2023,"Ramaphosa","What is clear from our experience of the last few years – indeed from our history as a democracy – is that we are not a people easily resigned to our fate.   "
"54",2023,"Ramaphosa","When we faced the greatest challenge of apartheid, we did not submit to the oppression that the apartheid regime imposed on our people.     "
"55",2023,"Ramaphosa","We stood firm and engaged in a struggle, hopeful that our cause would triumph. "
"56",2023,"Ramaphosa","And it did. "
"57",2023,"Ramaphosa","Against all odds we were able to defeat the apartheid system.    "
"58",2023,"Ramaphosa","We can, and we will change the circumstances in which we find ourselves today.      "
"59",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are both able and determined to overcome these difficulties and place our economy on a firm path to recovery.      "
"60",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our most immediate priority is to restore energy security.      "
"61",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are in the grip of a profound energy crisis, the seeds of which were planted many years ago.      "
"62",2023,"Ramaphosa","We cannot undo the mistakes that were made in the past, the capacity that was not built, the damage that was done to our power plants due to a lack of maintenance, or the effects of state capture on our institutions.      "
"63",2023,"Ramaphosa","What we can do is to fix the problem today, to keep the lights on tomorrow and for generations to come.      "
"64",2023,"Ramaphosa","In July last year, I announced a clear action plan to address the energy crisis.     "
"65",2023,"Ramaphosa","This was to address the electricity shortfall of 4 000 to 6 000 megawatts (MW).    "
"66",2023,"Ramaphosa","The plan outlined five key interventions:     First, fix Eskom’s coal-fired power stations and improve the availability of existing supply.         "
"67",2023,"Ramaphosa","Second, enable and accelerate private investment in generation capacity.     "
"68",2023,"Ramaphosa","Three, accelerate procurement of new capacity from renewables, gas and battery storage.    "
"69",2023,"Ramaphosa","Four, unleash businesses and households to invest in rooftop solar.     "
"70",2023,"Ramaphosa","Five, fundamentally transform the electricity sector to achieve long-term energy security.     "
"71",2023,"Ramaphosa","Experts agree that this plan is the most realistic route to end load-shedding.      "
"72",2023,"Ramaphosa","During the last six months, we have made important progress in implementing the plan.      "
"73",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have taken steps to improve the performance of Eskom’s existing power stations so that the coal-fired power stations that provide 80% of our electricity produce the amount of electricity for which they were designed.     "
"74",2023,"Ramaphosa","Under its new board, Eskom is deploying people and resources to improve the reliability of the six power stations that have contributed the most to load-shedding.      "
"75",2023,"Ramaphosa","Eskom is urgently fast-tracking construction of a temporary solution to bring back three units at Kusile power station following the collapse of a chimney stack last year, whilst simultaneously repairing the permanent structure.     "
"76",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are rebuilding the skills that have been lost and have already recruited skilled personnel at senior levels to be deployed at underperforming power stations.      "
"77",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Engineering Council of South Africa has offered to give as much assistance as required by deploying engineers to work with the management teams at power stations.     "
"78",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have deep skills and expertise right here in South Africa – we just need to use them.     "
"79",2023,"Ramaphosa","National Treasury is finalising a solution to Eskom’s R400 billion debt burden in a manner that is equitable and fair to all stakeholders, which will enable the utility to make necessary investments in maintenance and transmission.     "
"80",2023,"Ramaphosa","Government will support Eskom to secure additional funding to purchase diesel for the rest of the financial year. "
"81",2023,"Ramaphosa","This should reduce the severity of load-shedding as Eskom will be able to use its diesel-run plants when the system is under strain.     "
"82",2023,"Ramaphosa","Eskom has launched a programme to buy excess power from private generators and has already secured 300 MW from our neighbouring countries.     "
"83",2023,"Ramaphosa","The South African Police Service (SAPS) has established a dedicated team with senior leadership to deal with the pervasive corruption and theft at several power stations that has contributed to the poor performance of these stations. "
"84",2023,"Ramaphosa","Intelligence-driven operations at Eskom-related sites have so far resulted in 43 arrests.      "
"85",2023,"Ramaphosa","As part of the broader reform process, the restructuring of Eskom that we previously announced is proceeding and the National Transmission Company will be soon operational with an independent board.      "
"86",2023,"Ramaphosa","Later this year, we will table the Electricity Regulation Amendment Bill to transform the energy sector and establish a competitive electricity market.      "
"87",2023,"Ramaphosa","As indicated in July last year, and with a view to addressing the load-shedding crisis, we are going to proceed with the rollout of rooftop solar panels.     "
"88",2023,"Ramaphosa","In his Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance will outline how households will be assisted and how businesses will be able to benefit from a tax incentive.     "
"89",2023,"Ramaphosa","National Treasury is working on adjustments to the bounce-back loan scheme to help small businesses invest in solar equipment, and to allow banks and development finance institutions to borrow directly from the scheme to facilitate the leasing of solar panels to their customers.     "
"90",2023,"Ramaphosa","One of the potent reforms we have embarked upon is to allow private developers to generate electricity. "
"91",2023,"Ramaphosa","There are now more than 100 projects, which are expected to provide over 9 000 MW of new capacity over time.      "
"92",2023,"Ramaphosa","A number of companies that have participated in the renewable energy programme will soon enter construction and deliver a total of 2 800 MW of new capacity.      "
"93",2023,"Ramaphosa","Eskom will procure emergency power that can be deployed within six months to close the immediate gap.      "
"94",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are investing in new transmission lines and substations, especially in areas such as the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Western Cape.     "
"95",2023,"Ramaphosa","All of these measures will result in a massive increase in power to the grid over the next 12 to 18 months, and beyond.      "
"96",2023,"Ramaphosa","This power will be in line with our diverse mix of energy sources, including our current coal-fired power stations, solar, wind, gas, nuclear, hydro and battery storage.    "
"97",2023,"Ramaphosa","To fully implement this plan, we need strong central coordination and decisive action.      "
"98",2023,"Ramaphosa","In a time of crisis, we need a single point of command and a single line of march.      "
"99",2023,"Ramaphosa","Just as we address the cause of the crisis, we also need to address its impact.      "
"100",2023,"Ramaphosa","The crisis has progressively evolved to affect every part of society.     "
"101",2023,"Ramaphosa","We must act to lessen the impact of the crisis on farmers, on small businesses, on our water infrastructure and our transport network.      "
"102",2023,"Ramaphosa","The National Disaster Management Centre has consequently classified the energy crisis and its impact as a disaster.      "
"103",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are, therefore, declaring a national state of disaster to respond to the electricity crisis and its effects.     "
"104",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs has just gazetted the declaration of the state of disaster, which will begin with immediate effect.    "
"105",2023,"Ramaphosa","The state of disaster will enable us to provide practical measures that we need to take to support businesses in the food production, storage and retail supply chain, including for the roll-out of generators, solar panels and uninterrupted power supply.    "
"106",2023,"Ramaphosa","Where technically possible, it will enable us to exempt critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water treatment plants from load-shedding.    "
"107",2023,"Ramaphosa","And it will enable us to accelerate energy projects and limit regulatory requirements while maintaining rigorous environmental protections, procurement principles and technical standards.    "
"108",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Auditor-General will be brought in to ensure continuous monitoring of expenditure, in order to guard against any abuses of the funds needed to attend to this disaster.     "
"109",2023,"Ramaphosa","To deal more effectively and urgently with the challenges that confront us, I will appoint a Minister of Electricity in The Presidency to assume full responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the electricity crisis response, including the work of the National Energy Crisis Committee.      "
"110",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Minister will focus full-time and work with the Eskom board and management on ending load-shedding and ensuring that the Energy Action Plan is implemented without delay.     "
"111",2023,"Ramaphosa","So as to remove any confusion, the Minister of Public Enterprises will remain the shareholder representative of Eskom and steer the restructuring of Eskom, ensure the establishment of the transmission company, oversee the implementation of the just energy transition programme, and oversee the establishment of the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Holding Company.    "
"112",2023,"Ramaphosa","The process of restructuring government will give us an opportunity to determine the positioning of various areas of responsibilities and how best the various ministries and departments can best serve our national objectives. "
"113",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are focusing our attention on the energy crisis right now and will address the restructuring of government in due course.    "
"114",2023,"Ramaphosa","This is necessary because an effective response to this crisis involves several different departments and entities that require coordination from the centre of government.     "
"115",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will be including other social partners in an effective structure similar to the one we set up to drive the vaccine rollout.     "
"116",2023,"Ramaphosa","Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures.      "
"117",2023,"Ramaphosa","The energy crisis is an existential threat to our economy and social fabric.      "
"118",2023,"Ramaphosa","We must spare no effort, and we must allow no delay, in implementing these measures.     "
"119",2023,"Ramaphosa","As we take these actions to resolve the energy crisis, we are mindful of the risks that climate change poses to our society.      "
"120",2023,"Ramaphosa","Extreme weather events in the form of drought, floods and wild fires increasingly pose a risk to the health, well-being and safety of people.      "
"121",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will continue our just transition to a low carbon economy at a pace our country can afford and in a manner that ensures energy security.      "
"122",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will undertake our just transition in a way that opens up the possibility of new investments, new industrialisation and that, above all, creates new jobs.     "
"123",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential Climate Commission is guiding much of this work, and, in doing so, building a new model for inclusive and collective decision making, incorporating the individuals, workers, and communities that are most affected in the transition.      "
"124",2023,"Ramaphosa","Through the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, R1.5 trillion will be invested in our economy over the next five years in new frontiers such as renewable energy, green hydrogen and electric vehicles.      "
"125",2023,"Ramaphosa","Several new sectors are emerging in the economy, such as major green hydrogen, electric vehicles and fuel cells.     "
"126",2023,"Ramaphosa","A number of projects are already underway, including the development of a new facility by Sasol at Boegoebaai in the Northern Cape, the Prieska Power Reserve in the Free State, and the Hydrogen Valley initiative in Limpopo, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.     "
"127",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Northern Cape has already attracted well over R100 billion in investments in renewable energy projects.     "
"128",2023,"Ramaphosa","These and other massive investments in renewable energy will create jobs and stimulate local economies not only in the Northern Cape, but also in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Mpumalanga, turning even the most arid desert into a giant energy source.      "
"129",2023,"Ramaphosa","Above all, our just transition will prioritise workers and communities in vulnerable industries to ensure that no one is left behind.      "
"130",2023,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,    Our economy needs to grow much faster if we are to meaningfully reduce unemployment.    "
"131",2023,"Ramaphosa","In the SoNA last year, we spoke of our intention to forge a comprehensive social compact that would join all social partners in a common programme to rebuild our economy and enable higher growth.     "
"132",2023,"Ramaphosa","We were not able to conclude a social compact in the timeframe we had envisaged because a number of new circumstances emerged that made it difficult for social partners to forge a consensus.    "
"133",2023,"Ramaphosa","The social partners have expressed their intention to conclude a social compact and have continued to work on a framework to enable joint action in key areas such as energy, transport and logistics, employment creation and skills development, investment and localisation, social protection, crime and corruption.    "
"134",2023,"Ramaphosa","While we remain committed to forging a new consensus among all sectors of our society, we have also undertaken practical collaboration in specific areas. "
"135",2023,"Ramaphosa","A number of other compacts have been concluded amongst social partners.    "
"136",2023,"Ramaphosa","We see the commitment of all social partners in the compacts that have been forged to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and undertake the largest vaccination programme in our history.     "
"137",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have seen it in initiatives like the Solidarity Fund that mobilised society, citizen activism and funding to achieve common goals, and in partnerships to end gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF), and to respond to the effects of climate change.     "
"138",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have seen the benefits of this approach to promote investment and to develop master plans in sectors of the economy such as automotive, clothing and textiles, poultry, sugar, agriculture and global business services.    "
"139",2023,"Ramaphosa","The master plans that have been concluded are supporting the revival of the relevant sectors, the injection of investment by the private sector and the creation of new jobs and livelihoods.     "
"140",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are pleased that social partners, particularly business, has been providing support to implement the Energy Action Plan in the spirit of social compacting. "
"141",2023,"Ramaphosa","Similarly, we have developed a close working partnership with both labour and community in supporting other aspects of the energy crisis response.     "
"142",2023,"Ramaphosa","Just as energy is essential for economic growth, so is a reliable water supply and an efficient transport and road infrastructure system.      "
"143",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our rail network has suffered from many years of underinvestment, lack of maintenance, criminal activity and inefficiency.    "
"144",2023,"Ramaphosa","To address this, last year, we adopted the National Rail Policy to guide the modernisation and reform of the rail sector, providing, among other things, for third-party access to our rail network.     "
"145",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are working across government to develop a Transnet Roadmap that will translate our policy commitments into reality, including the restructuring of Transnet Freight Rail to create a separate Infrastructure Manager for the rail network by October 2023.     "
"146",2023,"Ramaphosa","Transnet and private sector companies will conclude partnerships at the Durban and Ngqura container terminals, to enable new investment in our ports and improve their efficiency.    "
"147",2023,"Ramaphosa","This will help our ports regain their global position as some of the most efficient ports once again.    "
"148",2023,"Ramaphosa","There has been great success in repositioning the Port Elizabeth Automotive Terminal, which has more than doubled its capacity and has already seen an increase in exports.     "
"149",2023,"Ramaphosa","Many more vehicles destined for overseas markets are rolling off the Port Elizabeth Automotive Terminal.     "
"150",2023,"Ramaphosa","Transnet is also rehabilitating its idle locomotives and expanding its fleet.      "
"151",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have faced challenges in the transportation of commuters on passenger rail.    "
"152",2023,"Ramaphosa","Following the restructuring that is underway in the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, 13 commuter rail lines have been reopened, significantly reducing the cost of travel for many workers.      "
"153",2023,"Ramaphosa","The reliable supply of water is essential for the well-being of people and the growth of our economy.     "
"154",2023,"Ramaphosa","To ensure water security now and into the future, the Department of Water and Sanitation is leading the process of investing in major infrastructure projects across the country.      "
"155",2023,"Ramaphosa","After being delayed for several years, full-scale construction works for the Lesotho Highlands Phase Two project will commence this year.      "
"156",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Lesotho Highlands project is critical for ensuring security of water supply to Gauteng, Free State, Mpumalanga, North West and the Northern Cape.     "
"157",2023,"Ramaphosa","Several decades after it was first proposed and nine years after a sod-turning ceremony was held, the first phase of the Umzimvubu Water Project will start in the next financial year.     "
"158",2023,"Ramaphosa","This phase, which involves construction of the Ntabelanga Dam, irrigation infrastructure and the distribution of water to communities, will be financed by government.     "
"159",2023,"Ramaphosa","The next phase will be the construction of the Lilane Dam, which will include a hydropower station.   "
"160",2023,"Ramaphosa","Major projects to increase the capacity of the Clanwilliam Dam, Hazelmere Dam and the Tzaneen Dam will improve the supply of water to the West Coast, eThekwini and the eastern part of Limpopo.      "
"161",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we announced a comprehensive turnaround plan to streamline the process for water use licence applications, which is vital to enable greater investment.     "
"162",2023,"Ramaphosa","Since then, we have cleared the backlog of water-use licences and reduced the turnaround time for applications to 90 days.      "
"163",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our infrastructure build programme is gaining pace through the work of the Infrastructure Fund and Infrastructure South Africa, which has been established to support strategic infrastructure projects.    "
"164",2023,"Ramaphosa","One of the greatest obstacles to infrastructure investment is the lack of technical skills and project management capacity.     "
"165",2023,"Ramaphosa","To fix this, Infrastructure South Africa has been allocated R600 million for project preparation, specifically in rural and under-resourced areas.      "
"166",2023,"Ramaphosa","The support and planning mechanisms that we have put in place over several years are now starting to bear fruit in increased public investment in infrastructure.     "
"167",2023,"Ramaphosa","By January this year, projects worth R232 billion were under construction and projects worth nearly R4 billion had been completed.      "
"168",2023,"Ramaphosa","The completed projects include new human settlements in Gauteng, road upgrades and the development of small harbours.     "
"169",2023,"Ramaphosa","In a major development, the South African National Roads Agency – SANRAL – has awarded road construction contracts worth R18 billion over the last three months.     "
"170",2023,"Ramaphosa","The construction of the Msikaba Bridge and Mtentu Bridge will be finished and make travel in the Eastern Cape, much better.    "
"171",2023,"Ramaphosa","This investment will substantially benefit the construction industry and enable large-scale job creation, skills development and poverty relief, especially in nearby rural communities.      "
"172",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we said we would increase the construction of rural bridges as part of the Welisizwe programme, to enable residents to easily and safely reach schools, workplaces and amenities.      "
"173",2023,"Ramaphosa","Twenty-four bridges in KwaZulu-Natal are currently under construction and site preparations are being made for a further 24 bridges.     "
"174",2023,"Ramaphosa","In the telecommunications sector, the completion of the spectrum auction has unlocked new investment and contributed R14 billion to the fiscus.    "
"175",2023,"Ramaphosa","During the course of this year, we will migrate the remaining households to digital television signal and complete the switch-off of analogue transmission.      "
"176",2023,"Ramaphosa","This will release valuable spectrum for the roll-out of 5G mobile networks and will reduce the cost of data.      "
"177",2023,"Ramaphosa","These actions will bring us closer to our vision of affordable, high-speed Internet access for all.      "
"178",2023,"Ramaphosa","In the SoNA last year, we said that we would concentrate our efforts on mobilising greater levels of investment, which is essential to growing the economy and creating jobs.      "
"179",2023,"Ramaphosa","We said that we would give impetus to the campaign that we embarked on nearly five years ago to raise R1.2 trillion in new investment.      "
"180",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, the 4th South Africa Investment Conference (SAIC) raised R367 billion in investment commitments, bringing our five-year investment target firmly within sight.      "
"181",2023,"Ramaphosa","Over the last year, many of these commitments have resulted in the companies that made those commitments investing in new factories, call centres, solar power plants, undersea fibre optic cables, the expansion of production lines and the adoption of new technologies.      "
"182",2023,"Ramaphosa","Importantly, these investments have resulted in new jobs and new opportunities for small emerging businesses.      "
"183",2023,"Ramaphosa","On 13 April this year, we will hold our 5th SAIC.      "
"184",2023,"Ramaphosa","At this conference, we will set a new target to mobilise more than R2 trillion in new investment by 2028.      "
"185",2023,"Ramaphosa","The investments that have flowed into the economy to date have contributed to a substantial increase in local production.      "
"186",2023,"Ramaphosa","These investments have encouraged our efforts to buy local.      "
"187",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, I delivered the SoNA wearing a suit and shoes proudly made in South Africa.      "
"188",2023,"Ramaphosa","This evening, I am drinking water from a glass made in Wadeville last week by workers from Katlehong, Vosloorus and Germiston.      "
"189",2023,"Ramaphosa","For many years, South Africa has been importing its drinking glasses.     "
"190",2023,"Ramaphosa","Now we are increasingly making them locally.      "
"191",2023,"Ramaphosa","But it’s not just glasses.     "
"192",2023,"Ramaphosa","If you go to hospital for an operation, chances are you will receive an anaesthetic made in a world-class manufacturing facility in the Eastern Cape.      "
"193",2023,"Ramaphosa","During my State Visit to the United Kingdom last year, a South African firm obtained a licence to produce an oral vaccine for cholera for the first time here in South Africa.      "
"194",2023,"Ramaphosa","Competition merger agreements have provided for more fuel to be refined locally and more food to be bought from local farmers.      "
"195",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we committed to unlocking investment in the hemp and cannabis sector.     "
"196",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are moving to create the enabling conditions for the sector to grow.      "
"197",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development and the Department of Health will address existing conditions for the cultivation of hemp and cannabis to allow outdoor cultivation and collection of harvests from traditional farmers.      "
"198",2023,"Ramaphosa","This will unlock enormous economic energy in the rural areas of the country, especially in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.     "
"199",2023,"Ramaphosa","Urgent work is being finalised by government to create an enabling regulatory framework for a whole plant, all legitimate purposes approach for complimentary medicines, food, cosmetics, and industrial products, aligned to international conventions and best practices.     "
"200",2023,"Ramaphosa","This includes the reprioritisation of departmental budgets for sector development and support for traditional, black farmers, and the alignment of the SAPS enforcement with regulatory reforms.     "
"201",2023,"Ramaphosa","A growing economy must also be an increasingly inclusive economy.     "
"202",2023,"Ramaphosa","The inaugural Black Industrialists Conference in July last year showed the successes of black South Africans in producing food, car parts, furniture, clothing, steel, chemicals and mining products, creating many thousands of jobs and adding to our gross domestic product.      "
"203",2023,"Ramaphosa","We now have almost 1 000 black industrialists participating in the black industrialists programme.    "
"204",2023,"Ramaphosa","As an example of the technological prowess of these industrialists, one of the award winners at the conference was Astrofica Technologies, a company co-founded by a black woman, Jessie Ndaba, that provides data solutions for the operation of satellites.     "
"205",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have made progress in the last year in achieving greater levels of worker ownership in the economy.      "
"206",2023,"Ramaphosa","There are now more than 400 000 workers who own shares in the firms they work for.      "
"207",2023,"Ramaphosa","Growth and the creation of jobs in our economy will be driven by small- and medium-sized enterprises, cooperatives and informal businesses.      "
"208",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we launched the bounce-back loan scheme administered by banks and other financial institutions, and guaranteed by government, for companies that need finance to recover from the effects of the pandemic.      "
"209",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Department of Small Business Development will work with National Treasury on how the scheme can be strengthened to assist small and medium enterprises and businesses in the informal sector.     "
"210",2023,"Ramaphosa","To address the challenge of youth unemployment, the Employment Tax Incentive has been expanded to encourage businesses to hire more young people in large numbers.      "
"211",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, I announced that we would be seeking to reduce red tape so that we can rid our country of the unnecessary bureaucracy that often holds us back.      "
"212",2023,"Ramaphosa","The red tape reduction team in The Presidency under Mr Sipho Nkosi has been working with various departments to make it easier to do business.      "
"213",2023,"Ramaphosa","It has taken a collaborative approach, working with departments and agencies in areas such as the mining rights system, tourism transport operator licenses, visas and work permits, early childhood development and the informal sector.      "
"214",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will finalise amendments to the Businesses Act, 1991 (Act 71 of 1991) to reduce regulatory impediments for small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) and co-operatives and make it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses.      "
"215",2023,"Ramaphosa","Through the Small Enterprise Finance Agency – we plan to provide R1.4 billion in financing to over 90 000 entrepreneurs.      "
"216",2023,"Ramaphosa","Government, in partnership with the SA SME Fund is working to establish a R10 billion fund to support SMME growth. "
"217",2023,"Ramaphosa","Government is looking at the possibility of providing R2.5 billion for the fund and for the balance of R7.5 billion to be raised from the private sector.     "
"218",2023,"Ramaphosa","The licensing of the PostBank will lay the foundation for the creation of a state bank that will provide financial services to SMMEs, youth- and women-owned businesses and underserved communities.     "
"219",2023,"Ramaphosa","As the National Assembly considers the Postbank Amendment Bill, the Postbank is reviewing its service offerings so that it can provide a viable and affordable alternative to the commercial banks.      "
"220",2023,"Ramaphosa","The most effective and sustainable way to build an economy is to equip people with the skills and know-how to drive it.      "
"221",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have therefore been working to strengthen the link between the skills that we develop and the skills the workplace needs.      "
"222",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year, the National Skills Fund will provide R800 million to develop skills in the digital and technology sector through an innovative model that links payment for training to employment outcomes.      "
"223",2023,"Ramaphosa","We reiterate our call to companies, departments and SOEs to remove the requirement for work experience for young people seeking entry-level positions.     "
"224",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we said that we would place over 10 000 Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) college graduates in employment.      "
"225",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have surpassed that figure and have now set a target for 2023 of 20 000 TVET to be placed in employment.      "
"226",2023,"Ramaphosa","The number of students entering artisan training in TVET colleges will be increased from 17 000 to 30 000 in the 2023 academic year.      "
"227",2023,"Ramaphosa","One of the key ingredients for economic growth and competitiveness is the ability to attract skills which the economy needs.      "
"228",2023,"Ramaphosa","Having completed a comprehensive review of the work visa system, we will move quickly to implement the recommendations put forward.      "
"229",2023,"Ramaphosa","These include establishing a more flexible points-based system to attract skilled immigration, implementing a trusted employer scheme to make the visa process easier for large investors and streamlining application requirements.      "
"230",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will also be introducing a remote worker visa and a special dispensation for high-growth start-ups.    "
"231",2023,"Ramaphosa","While the reform programme is underway, we will continue to support public and social employment to provide work to those who need it.      "
"232",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we spoke about the value of the Presidential Employment Stimulus in providing work and livelihood opportunities.     "
"233",2023,"Ramaphosa","The initiative has now created over one million opportunities, reaching every province and district in our country.      "
"234",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last week, a new cohort of 150 000 school assistants started work at more than 22 000 schools, offering dignity, hope and vital work experience to young people who were unemployed.      "
"235",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Social Employment Fund is recruiting 50 000 participants in its next phase to undertake work for the common good, and the revitalised National Youth Service will create a further 36 000 opportunities through non-profit and community-based organisations.     "
"236",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Department of Home Affairs has appointed the first cohort of 10 000 unemployed young people to digitise more than 340 million paper-based civic records.     "
"237",2023,"Ramaphosa","There are now more than three million users registered on SAYouth.mobi, a zero-rated online platform for young South Africans to access opportunities for learning and earning.     "
"238",2023,"Ramaphosa","This has been done in close collaboration with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA), which continues to provide valuable assistance to young entrepreneurs and work seekers.     "
"239",2023,"Ramaphosa","I really applaud the NYDA in the manner in which it assists youth to secure employment.   "
"240",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential Employment Stimulus is also supporting people to earn their own living.      "
"241",2023,"Ramaphosa","Around 140 000 small-scale farmers have received input vouchers to buy seeds, fertiliser and equipment, providing a boost for food security and agricultural reform.      "
"242",2023,"Ramaphosa","This initiative has led to the cultivation of some 640 000 hectares of land.    "
"243",2023,"Ramaphosa","An impressive 68% of these farmers are women.     "
"244",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year, we aim to provide 250 000 more vouchers to small-scale farmers.     "
"245",2023,"Ramaphosa","These are examples of the difference that government can make in people’s lives through innovation, creativity and commitment.      "
"246",2023,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,    The rising cost of living is deepening poverty and inequality.      "
"247",2023,"Ramaphosa","Millions of South Africans are unable to provide for themselves and their families.      "
"248",2023,"Ramaphosa","There is the single mother in Alex, worried about how she will make ends meet as the cost of maize and taxi fares continues to rise.     "
"249",2023,"Ramaphosa","There is the factory worker in Gqeberha who now faces an uncertain future as load-shedding brings the assembly line to a halt.     "
"250",2023,"Ramaphosa","It is the job of the state to provide a minimum level of protection below which no South African will fall.     "
"251",2023,"Ramaphosa","Right now in our country, there are more than 25 million people who receive some form of income support.     "
"252",2023,"Ramaphosa","In addition, around two million indigent households receive free basic water, free basic electricity and free solid waste removal.     "
"253",2023,"Ramaphosa","Around 60% of our budget is spent on what is known as the social wage, providing various forms of support, basic services and assistance to households and individuals to combat poverty and hunger.     "
"254",2023,"Ramaphosa","In support of this work and to counter the rising cost of living, we will continue the Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant, which currently reaches around 7.8 million people.     "
"255",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will ensure that existing social grants are increased to cushion the poor against rising inflation.     "
"256",2023,"Ramaphosa","This will be set out in the budget by the Minister of Finance.    "
"257",2023,"Ramaphosa","Work is underway to develop a mechanism for targeted basic income support for the most vulnerable, within our fiscal constraints.     "
"258",2023,"Ramaphosa","This will build on the innovation we have introduced through the SRD Grant, including linking the data that we have across government to make sure we reach all those who are in need.     "
"259",2023,"Ramaphosa","National Treasury is considering the feasibility of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of load-shedding on food prices.      "
"260",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will take steps to unlock massive value for poor households by expediting the provision of title deeds for subsidised houses.     "
"261",2023,"Ramaphosa","The current backlog in processing title deeds is over one million houses, which amounts to an estimated R242 billion in assets that should be in the hands of South Africa’s poorest households.     "
"262",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will focus not just on eradicating this backlog, but on making the title deed system more effective and more accessible.    "
"263",2023,"Ramaphosa","As we undertook in the SoNA last year, the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure has finalised the transfer of 14 000 hectares of state land for housing.          "
"264",2023,"Ramaphosa","Access to quality education for all is the most powerful instrument we have to end poverty.     "
"265",2023,"Ramaphosa","We need to start with children who are very young, providing them with the foundation they need to write and read for meaning, to learn and develop.     "
"266",2023,"Ramaphosa","It is, therefore, significant that the number of children who receive the Early Childhood Development (ECD) subsidy has more than doubled between 2019 and 2022, reaching one-and-a-half million children.     "
"267",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Department of Basic Education is streamlining the requirements for ECD centres to access support and enable thousands more to receive subsidies from government.      "
"268",2023,"Ramaphosa","While at the other end of the basic education journey, we must applaud last year’s matric pass rate of 80%, with all provinces showing improved results.      "
"269",2023,"Ramaphosa","This was up from 76% the year before.      "
"270",2023,"Ramaphosa","The share of bachelor passes in no-fee schools improved from 55% in 2019 to 64% in 2022.      "
"271",2023,"Ramaphosa","This means that the performance of learners from poorer schools is steadily improving, confirming the value of the support that government provides to them.      "
"272",2023,"Ramaphosa","What these results reveal is that there is a silent revolution taking place in our schools.      "
"273",2023,"Ramaphosa","Schools must be safe and allow for effective learning and teaching.      "
"274",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Sanitation Appropriate for Education Initiative – known as SAFE – together with government’s Accelerated School Infrastructure Delivery Initiative has built 55 000 appropriate toilets with resources from the public and private sector.     "
"275",2023,"Ramaphosa","To produce the skills our country needs, we are expanding vocational education and training systems through the implementation of the approved curriculum of the three stream model.      "
"276",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year, government plans to finalise the Comprehensive Student Funding Model for higher education, particularly for students who fall outside the current National Student Financial Aid Scheme criteria; reaching those who are known as the ‘missing middle’.      "
"277",2023,"Ramaphosa","Honourable members,    Violent crime takes a heavy toll on every South African.     "
"278",2023,"Ramaphosa","Communities across our country live in fear for the safety of their families.     "
"279",2023,"Ramaphosa","This situation cannot continue.     "
"280",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are strengthening the SAPS to prevent crime and improving the capacity of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and courts to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.      "
"281",2023,"Ramaphosa","This includes putting more police on the streets and setting up specialised teams that will focus on specific types of crime.     "
"282",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we undertook to recruit 12 000 new police personnel.      "
"283",2023,"Ramaphosa","Since then, more than 10 000 new recruits graduated from police academies and a further  10 000 will be recruited and trained this year.      "
"284",2023,"Ramaphosa","The specialised police teams that are working on tackling crimes like kidnapping, extortion and illegal mining have had several breakthroughs, arresting dozens of suspects and achieving several convictions.      "
"285",2023,"Ramaphosa","Firm action is being taken to tackle economic sabotage and related crimes that are causing great damage to the economy.      "
"286",2023,"Ramaphosa","Multi-disciplinary Economic Infrastructure Task Teams are now operational in 20 identified hotspots.      "
"287",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, I drew attention to the enormous damage caused by the theft of copper cable and metal from our electricity system, train lines and other public infrastructure.      "
"288",2023,"Ramaphosa","Since then, the police have been cracking down on cable theft.      "
"289",2023,"Ramaphosa","In December, government introduced a temporary ban on the export of scrap copper cable and certain metals to disrupt criminal syndicates and enable a new trading system to be put in place.      "
"290",2023,"Ramaphosa","Just as we have embarked on economic reforms in electricity, water, telecommunication and logistics through Operation Vulindlela, we are embarking on a process of reform to improve the effectiveness of our fight against crime.      "
"291",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will use our competitiveness in call centre operations to support the proper functioning of the 10111 help line, partnering with the private sector.      "
"292",2023,"Ramaphosa","This is to ensure that when people call the police, their calls are answered and their emergencies are attended to.     "
"293",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will also use data driven methods in a more sophisticated way to identify and target crime hotspots.     "
"294",2023,"Ramaphosa","Significantly, more funding will be made available in this budget for the police, the NPA and the Special Investigating Unit.          "
"295",2023,"Ramaphosa","Crimes against women and children remain a deeply disturbing feature of our national life.      "
"296",2023,"Ramaphosa","In November last year, we held the second Presidential Summit on GBVF to assess progress in the implementation of the National Strategic Plan, which adopted as a comprehensive, effective and united response to this pandemic.     "
"297",2023,"Ramaphosa","One of the great successes of our effort to fight GBV is the extent to which social partners have rallied around the National Strategic Plan.     "
"298",2023,"Ramaphosa","In January last year, I signed into law three key pieces of legislation that afford greater protection to survivors of GBV and ensure that perpetrators are no longer able to use legislative loopholes to evade prosecution.     "
"299",2023,"Ramaphosa","We continue to improve the accessibility and functioning of Sexual Offences Courts and expand the network of Thuthuzela Care Centres.     "
"300",2023,"Ramaphosa","A key aspect of the National Strategic Plan is the economic empowerment of women.     "
"301",2023,"Ramaphosa","Since announcing our determination to direct at least 40% of public procurement to women-owned businesses, we have sought to establish an enabling environment to support women entrepreneurs.     "
"302",2023,"Ramaphosa","We have trained more than 3 400 women-owned enterprises to prepare them to take up procurement opportunities.     "
"303",2023,"Ramaphosa","Through the Women’s Economic Assembly, we have seen industry associations and companies committing to industry-wide gender transformation targets.     "
"304",2023,"Ramaphosa","The Industrial Development Corporation has earmarked approximately R9 billion to invest in women-led businesses.      "
"305",2023,"Ramaphosa","Other entities, including the Public Investment Corporation and the National Empowerment Fund, have also committed to establish special purpose vehicles to support women-owned businesses.      "
"306",2023,"Ramaphosa","We must all play our part, as individuals, institutions and leaders across society, to end these crimes against women and children.     "
"307",2023,"Ramaphosa","Last year, I said that we would take decisive action against corruption and make a clear break with the era of state capture.      "
"308",2023,"Ramaphosa","The State Capture Commission headed by Chief Justice Raymond Zondo completed its work and submitted the final part of its report in June last year.      "
"309",2023,"Ramaphosa","As a country, we owe Chief Justice Zondo, the Commission staff and all those who provided testimony a huge debt of gratitude for their extraordinary public service.      "
"310",2023,"Ramaphosa","The recommendations of the Commission are being implemented according to the plan that I submitted to Parliament in October last year so that the systemic weaknesses identified by the Commission are addressed and state capture is never allowed to occur again.      "
"311",2023,"Ramaphosa","The National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, consisting of people from across society, is in place to advise on suitable mechanisms to stem corruption, including an overhaul the institutional architecture for combatting corruption.      "
"312",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are working to capacitate the Witness Protection Unit and will introduce amendments to the Protected Disclosures Act, 2000 (Act 26 of 2000)  and Witness Protection Act, 1998 (Act 112 of 1998) to strengthen protections for whistle-blowers.      "
"313",2023,"Ramaphosa","Work is already underway to improve access to the witness protection programme for public servants that expose maladministration, corruption and unethical conduct.      "
"314",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will finalise the draft Public Procurement Bill to address weaknesses identified by the State Capture Commission and improve efficiency, value for money and transparency.      "
"315",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our reinvigorated law enforcement agencies are taking firm action against companies and individuals alleged to have been involved in state capture.      "
"316",2023,"Ramaphosa","The NPA Investigating Directorate, which I established in 2019, has taken 187 accused persons to court in 32 state capture and corruption cases.      "
"317",2023,"Ramaphosa","Over R7 billion has so far been returned to the state from state capture cases.      "
"318",2023,"Ramaphosa","To date, R12.9 billion of funds and assets have been frozen.      "
"319",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year, the Investigating Directorate will be established as a permanent entity within the NPA.      "
"320",2023,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,    To achieve any progress in addressing the urgent challenges we face, we need a capable and effective State.     "
"321",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our greatest weaknesses are in state-owned enterprises and local government.     "
"322",2023,"Ramaphosa","Many of our SOEs are struggling with significant debt, under-investment in infrastructure, the effects of state capture and a shortage of skills.      "
"323",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will implement the recommendation of the Presidential SOE Council to establish a state-owned holding company as part of a centralised shareholder model that will ensure effective oversight of SOEs.      "
"324",2023,"Ramaphosa","Separately, I have instructed The Presidency and National Treasury to work together to rationalise government departments, entities and programmes over the next three years.     "
"325",2023,"Ramaphosa","National Treasury estimates that we could achieve a potential saving of R27 billion in the medium term if we deal with overlapping mandates, close ineffective programmes and consolidate entities where appropriate.     "
"326",2023,"Ramaphosa","The poor performance of many local governments remains an area of concern.      "
"327",2023,"Ramaphosa","Too many of our municipalities, 163 out of 257, are dysfunctional or in distress due to poor governance, ineffective and sometimes corrupt financial and administrative management and poor service delivery.     "
"328",2023,"Ramaphosa","Government is implementing a number of interventions to address failures at local government level and improve basic service delivery.      "
"329",2023,"Ramaphosa","These include enhancing the capacity of public representatives and officials, maintaining and upgrading local infrastructure, and invoking the powers of national government to intervene where municipalities fail to meet their responsibilities.      "
"330",2023,"Ramaphosa","A professional public service, staffed by skilled, committed and ethical people, is critical to an effective state and ending corruption, patronage and wastage.      "
"331",2023,"Ramaphosa","In response to the State Capture Commission and in line with the framework for the professionalisation of the public service, integrity assessments will become a mandatory requirement for recruitment to the public service and entry exams will be introduced.      "
"332",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are amending legislation and strengthening the role of the Public Service Commission to ensure that qualified people are appointed to senior management positions and to move towards creating a single, harmonised public service.     "
"333",2023,"Ramaphosa","Honourable members,    Just as we are committed to improving the fortunes of our countrymen and women and to advancing shared prosperity for all, so too is our commitment to achieving a Better Africa and a Better world.    "
"334",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are greatly concerned at the recent escalation of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, and call for an end to hostilities and for a resumption of the stalled peace process.    "
"335",2023,"Ramaphosa","South Africa expresses its deepest condolences to the government and people of Türkiye following the devastating earthquake earlier this week.     "
"336",2023,"Ramaphosa","As a country we are immensely proud of the efforts of Gift of the Givers to help those affected by the earthquake.    "
"337",2023,"Ramaphosa","We remain deeply concerned about the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and urge all parties to cease hostilities and seek a peaceful solution through dialogue.    "
"338",2023,"Ramaphosa","South Africa’s fortunes are inextricably linked to those of our continent, and to the Southern African Development Community in particular.    "
"339",2023,"Ramaphosa","For the sake of our own stability and prosperity, we are duty bound to pursue interventions that will bring peace, stability and development in our continent.     "
"340",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to expand trade and investment opportunities with our global trade partners and will look to attract investment and financing to South Africa through our participation in multilateral forums such as the G20, which we will host in 2025.    "
"341",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year South Africa assumes the chairship of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa group of countries.    "
"342",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our focus will be on collaboration on sustainable development, the just energy transition, industrialisation and the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.    "
"343",2023,"Ramaphosa","South Africa, together with our neighbours in the Southern African Customs Union, will soon finalise our industrial offer on the African Continental Free Trade Area.    "
"344",2023,"Ramaphosa","Once fully operationalised, the Continental Free Trade will provide an unprecedented opportunity to deepen African economic integration, grow national economies, and open up new frontiers and markets for South African companies.    "
"345",2023,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,      A nation’s true character is revealed in times of crisis.      "
"346",2023,"Ramaphosa","A nation is defined by how its people meet the gravest of difficulties – whether they work together and confront their challenges as one, united by a common purpose, or whether they surrender to the problems before them.      "
"347",2023,"Ramaphosa","We are a nation seized with the challenges of the present, but we are also a nation striving to fulfil the promise of our future.      "
"348",2023,"Ramaphosa","When we took our first steps on the road to democracy, we had a clear vision of where that road would lead us.      "
"349",2023,"Ramaphosa","We saw a country in which all people were equal.      "
"350",2023,"Ramaphosa","We saw a country in which the wealth of our resources would be enjoyed by all.      "
"351",2023,"Ramaphosa","We saw a country in which we could live together in peace, in which we could work together to build a common identity and a shared future.      "
"352",2023,"Ramaphosa","Our nation is founded on a Constitution which affirms the democratic values of dignity, equality and freedom, and the rights of each and every one of us.      "
"353",2023,"Ramaphosa","The actions we have outlined this evening, building on the work we have already done, will bring us closer to that vision.      "
"354",2023,"Ramaphosa","They will enable us, working together and with purpose, to emerge from this crisis as a nation transformed.      "
"355",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will emerge from this crisis with an electricity system that is more efficient, more reliable and more competitive.      "
"356",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will emerge with ports and railways that again rival the best in the world, with broadband access for more South Africans in more parts of the country, and with a sustainable supply of quality water.      "
"357",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will welcome more tourists to our country, and develop and attract the skills our economy needs.      "
"358",2023,"Ramaphosa","We will create work for those who are unemployed, and give hope to those who have waited too long.      "
"359",2023,"Ramaphosa","With more police on the street, with functioning community policing forums and an effective and independent prosecution authority, our people will be able to count on the protection of the State.      "
"360",2023,"Ramaphosa","By fighting economic sabotage and organised crime, our infrastructure will be more secure and businesses will be able to operate more freely.      "
"361",2023,"Ramaphosa","Through a strengthened and expanded social protection system, fewer people will live in poverty and fewer households will experience hunger.      "
"362",2023,"Ramaphosa","We must do all of these things, not only to overcome our immediate challenges, but to renew the promise of South Africa.      "
"363",2023,"Ramaphosa","It is a promise that we have kept alive in our hearts and in our actions.      "
"364",2023,"Ramaphosa","This year, it will be 10 years since we bid farewell to Nelson Mandela, the first President of a democratic South Africa, our beloved Madiba. "
"365",2023,"Ramaphosa","It will also be 105 years since his birth.    "
"366",2023,"Ramaphosa","As we honour his great life, let us draw inspiration from the words he spoke at his inauguration in 1994, when he said:    “Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.    "
"367",2023,"Ramaphosa","“Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.”    "
"368",2023,"Ramaphosa","To build such a society, to overcome the great difficulties of the moment, we need to work together. "
"369",2023,"Ramaphosa","We need to stay the course.      "
"370",2023,"Ramaphosa","We need, as a nation, at this time more than any other, to reveal our true character.     "
"371",2023,"Ramaphosa","We need to work together and leave no one behind.     "
"372",2023,"Ramaphosa","I thank you. "
"373",2022,"Ramaphosa"," Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Mr Amos Masondo, Deputy President David Mabuza, Former President Thabo Mbeki, Former Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Former Deputy President Baleka Mbete, Former Speaker of the National Assembly, Mr Max Sisulu, Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, Mayor of the City of Cape Town, Mr Geordin Hill-Lewis, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, Mr Bene M'Poko, Members of the Judiciary, Heads of Institutions Supporting Democracy, Members of Parliament, Fellow South Africans,  This year, for the first time since the dawn of our democracy, the SoNA is not being delivered in the Chamber of the National Assembly.  "
"374",2022,"Ramaphosa","As we entered this new year, a huge fire engulfed the seat of our democracy.  "
"375",2022,"Ramaphosa","We all watched in outrage and sadness as the flames devoured the buildings in which our democratic Constitution was born, in which laws of transformation and progress have been passed, in which the freely-chosen representatives of the people have shaped our young nation.  "
"376",2022,"Ramaphosa","For many, what happened in Parliament speaks to a broader devastation in our land.  "
"377",2022,"Ramaphosa","For many, the fire was symbolic of the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, by rising unemployment and deepening poverty.  "
"378",2022,"Ramaphosa","It spoke to the devastation of a pandemic that over the past two years has taken the lives of tens of thousands of South Africans, put two million people out of work and brought misery to families.  "
"379",2022,"Ramaphosa","The fire in Parliament reminded us of the destruction, violence and looting that we witnessed in parts of the country in July last year, of the more than 300 lives lost and many more livelihoods ruined.  "
"380",2022,"Ramaphosa","As we reflect on the past year, we recall the words of President Thabo Mbeki who reminded us that: “Trying times need courage and resilience. "
"381",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our strength as a people is not tested during the best of times”.  "
"382",2022,"Ramaphosa","That we are gathered together in the Cape Town City Hall instead of the National Assembly Chamber reflects the extraordinary circumstances of this time.  "
"383",2022,"Ramaphosa","It reflects the determination of the Presiding Officers of Parliament and indeed all the members of our two houses that the work of this democratic institution should continue without interruption.  "
"384",2022,"Ramaphosa","There are moments in the life of a nation when old certainties are unsettled and new possibilities emerge.  "
"385",2022,"Ramaphosa","In these moments, there is both the prospect of great progress and the risk of reversal.  "
"386",2022,"Ramaphosa","Today, we are faced with such a moment.  "
"387",2022,"Ramaphosa","The path we choose now will determine the course for future generations.  "
"388",2022,"Ramaphosa","That is why we are taking steps to strengthen our democracy and reaffirm our commitment to a Constitution that protects us all.  "
"389",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are working together to revitalise our economy and end the inequality and injustice that impedes our progress.  "
"390",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are standing together against corruption and to ensure that those who are responsible for state capture are punished for their crimes.  "
"391",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are rebuilding the State and restoring trust and pride in public institutions.  "
"392",2022,"Ramaphosa","If there is one thing we all agree on, it is that the present situation – of deep poverty, unemployment and inequality – is unacceptable and unsustainable.  "
"393",2022,"Ramaphosa","There is agreement among a broad and diverse range of South Africans that fundamental reforms are needed to revive economic growth.  "
"394",2022,"Ramaphosa","There is a need both to address the immediate crisis and to create conditions for long-lasting stability and development.  "
"395",2022,"Ramaphosa","To achieve this, South Africa needs a new consensus.  "
"396",2022,"Ramaphosa","A consensus that is born out of a common understanding of our current challenging situation and a recognition of the need to address the challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality.  "
"397",2022,"Ramaphosa","This should be a new consensus which recognises that the State must create an environment in which the private sector can invest and unleash the dynamism of the economy.  "
"398",2022,"Ramaphosa","But equally, an environment in which South Africans can live a better life and unleash the energy of their capabilities.  "
"399",2022,"Ramaphosa","This should also be a new consensus which embraces our shared responsibility to one another, and acknowledges that we are all in this together.  "
"400",2022,"Ramaphosa","As the social partners – government, labour, business and communities – we are working to determine the actions we will take together to build such a consensus.  "
"401",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have begun discussions on what trade-offs are needed and what contribution we will each need to make.  "
"402",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have given ourselves 100 days to finalise a comprehensive social compact to grow our economy, create jobs and combat hunger.  "
"403",2022,"Ramaphosa","This work will build on the foundation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP), which remains our common programme to rebuild the economy,  We remain focused on the priorities we identified in the SoNA last year:  overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive rollout of infrastructure, a substantial increase in local production, an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity.   "
"404",2022,"Ramaphosa","To be effective, this social compact needs to include every South African and every part of our society.  "
"405",2022,"Ramaphosa","No one must be left behind.  "
"406",2022,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  When I last addressed the state of our nation, we were deep in the throes of the worst pandemic in more than a century.  "
"407",2022,"Ramaphosa","Since COVID-19 reached our shores, we have endured successive waves of infection, the emergence of new variants and the devastating cost of nearly 100 000 recorded COVID-19 deaths.  "
"408",2022,"Ramaphosa","South Africans have responded to this grave threat with courage and resilience, with compassion and restraint.  "
"409",2022,"Ramaphosa","Over the past two years, we have taken unprecedented actions to strengthen our health system, build laboratory capacity and prevent infections.  "
"410",2022,"Ramaphosa","The nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the dedicated healthcare workers and other frontline staff who put their health and their lives at risk to care for the ill and vulnerable during this pandemic.  "
"411",2022,"Ramaphosa","Within weeks of the first reported infection in our country, I announced the establishment of the Solidarity Fund, with the goal of uniting the country in the fight against the pandemic.  "
"412",2022,"Ramaphosa","In a wave of generosity that swept the country, the fund raised R3.4 billion from more than 300 000 individuals and 3 000 companies and foundations. "
"413",2022,"Ramaphosa","More than 400 individuals and 100 companies volunteered their time and services.  "
"414",2022,"Ramaphosa","The fund has played a pivotal role in supporting the national health response and alleviating the humanitarian crisis.  "
"415",2022,"Ramaphosa","I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the Solidarity Fund and the great many who came together in countless other initiatives to support those affected by the pandemic.  "
"416",2022,"Ramaphosa","As the trajectory of the pandemic has continued to change, we have had to adapt and evolve.  "
"417",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our approach has been informed throughout by the best available scientific evidence, and we have stood out both for the quality of our scientists and for their involvement in every step of our response.  "
"418",2022,"Ramaphosa","During the past year, we have focused on accelerating our vaccine rollout.  "
"419",2022,"Ramaphosa","So far, we have administered 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. "
"420",2022,"Ramaphosa","Consequently, nearly 42% of all adults and 60% of everyone over 50 is fully vaccinated.  "
"421",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are now ready to enter a new phase in our management of the pandemic.  "
"422",2022,"Ramaphosa","It is our intention to end the national state of disaster as soon as we have finalised other measures under the National Health Act, 2003 (Act 61 0f 2003) and other legislation to contain the pandemic.  "
"423",2022,"Ramaphosa","Nearly all restrictions on economic and social activity have already been lifted.  "
"424",2022,"Ramaphosa","Vaccines have proven to be the best defence we have against illness and death from COVID-19.  "
"425",2022,"Ramaphosa","If we all get vaccinated, continue to observe basic health measures and remain ever vigilant, we will be able to get on with our lives even with the virus in our midst.  "
"426",2022,"Ramaphosa","The state of the nation is linked inextricably to the state of our economy.  "
"427",2022,"Ramaphosa","In addition to the divides of race, geography and education, COVID-19 has exacerbated the divide between those who are employed and unemployed.  "
"428",2022,"Ramaphosa","Last year, our unemployment rate reached its highest recorded level.  "
"429",2022,"Ramaphosa","Unemployment has been caused by low growth, which has in turn resulted from a long-term decline in investment.  "
"430",2022,"Ramaphosa","In the last year, we have benefited from a clear and stable macroeconomic framework, strong commodity prices and a better-than-expected recovery.  "
"431",2022,"Ramaphosa","However, we have been held back by an unreliable electricity supply, inefficient network industries and the high cost of doing business.  "
"432",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have been taking extraordinary measures to enable businesses to grow and create jobs alongside expanded public employment and social protection.  "
"433",2022,"Ramaphosa","We all know that government does not create jobs. "
"434",2022,"Ramaphosa","Business creates jobs.  "
"435",2022,"Ramaphosa","Around 80% of all the people employed in South Africa are employed in the private sector.  "
"436",2022,"Ramaphosa","The key task of government is to create the conditions that will enable the private sector – both big and small – to emerge, to grow, to access new markets, to create new products, and to hire more employees.  "
"437",2022,"Ramaphosa","The problems in the South African economy are deep and they are structural.  "
"438",2022,"Ramaphosa","When electricity supply cannot be guaranteed, when railways and ports are inefficient, when innovation is held back by a scarcity of broadband spectrum, when water quality deteriorates, companies are reluctant to invest and the economy cannot function properly.  "
"439",2022,"Ramaphosa","With a view to addressing these challenges we are accelerating the implementation of far-reaching structural reforms to modernise and transform these industries, unlock investment, reduce costs and increase competitiveness and growth.  "
"440",2022,"Ramaphosa","The electricity crisis is one of the greatest threats to economic and social progress.  "
"441",2022,"Ramaphosa","In the last few days, we have once again been reminded of the fragility of our electricity system.  "
"442",2022,"Ramaphosa","Load shedding continues to have a huge impact on the lives of all South Africans, disrupting business activities, and placing additional strains on families and communities.  "
"443",2022,"Ramaphosa","Due to our aging power stations, poor maintenance, policy missteps and the ruinous effects of state capture, our country has a shortfall of around 4000 MW of electricity.  "
"444",2022,"Ramaphosa","During the past year, we have taken firm steps to bring additional generation capacity online as quickly as possible to close the shortfall.  "
"445",2022,"Ramaphosa","As a result, several new energy generation projects will be coming online over the next few years. "
"446",2022,"Ramaphosa","This includes:  Over 500 MW from the remaining projects in Bid Window 4 of the renewable energy programme, which are at advanced stages of construction. "
"447",2022,"Ramaphosa","2 600 MW from Bid Window 5 of the renewable energy programme, for which the preferred bidders were announced last year, up to 800 MW from those risk mitigation power projects that are ready to proceed, 2 600 MW from Bid Window 6 of the renewal energy programme, which will soon be opened, 3,000 MW of gas power and 500 MW of battery storage, for which requests for proposals will be released later this year, an estimated 4 000 MW from embedded generation projects in the mining sector, approximately 1 400 MW currently in the process of being secured by various municipalities.   "
"448",2022,"Ramaphosa","In addition to closing the energy supply shortfall, we are implementing fundamental changes to the structure of the electricity sector.  "
"449",2022,"Ramaphosa","Eskom has established a separate transmission subsidiary, and is on track to complete its unbundling by December 2022.  "
"450",2022,"Ramaphosa","The utility has continued with its intensive maintenance programme, to reverse many years of neglected maintenance and underperformance of existing plants.  "
"451",2022,"Ramaphosa","To regulate all of these reforms, Cabinet yesterday approved amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act of 2006) for public comment.  "
"452",2022,"Ramaphosa","These far-reaching amendments will enable a competitive market for electricity generation and the establishment of an independent state-owned transmission company.  "
"453",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our economy cannot grow without efficient ports and railways.  "
"454",2022,"Ramaphosa","Over several years, the functioning of our ports has declined relative to ports in other parts of the world and on the African continent. "
"455",2022,"Ramaphosa","This constrains economic activity.  "
"456",2022,"Ramaphosa","The agricultural sector, for example, relies heavily on efficient, well-run ports to export their produce to overseas markets.  "
"457",2022,"Ramaphosa","Fresh produce cannot wait for days and even weeks stuck in a terminal.  "
"458",2022,"Ramaphosa","This hurts businesses and compromises our country’s reputation as an exporter of quality fresh produce.  "
"459",2022,"Ramaphosa","Transnet is addressing these challenges and is currently focused on improving operational efficiencies at the ports through procuring additional equipment and implementing new systems to reduce congestion.  "
"460",2022,"Ramaphosa","Transnet will ask for proposals from private partners for the Durban and Ngqura Container Terminals within the next few months, which will enable partnerships to be in place at both terminals by October 2022.  "
"461",2022,"Ramaphosa","Transnet will start the process of providing third-party access to its freight rail network from April 2022 by making slots available on the container corridor between Durban and City Deep in Gauteng.  "
"462",2022,"Ramaphosa","Transnet has developed partnerships with the private sector to address cable theft and vandalism on the freight rail network through advanced technologies and additional security personnel.  "
"463",2022,"Ramaphosa","This collaborative effort is already showing results in reduced disruptions to rail operations.  "
"464",2022,"Ramaphosa","The poor state of passenger rail in South Africa has a direct and detrimental impact on the lives of our people.  "
"465",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are therefore working hard to rehabilitate the passenger rail network in 10 priority corridors.  "
"466",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Southern Line in Cape Town and the Mabopane Line in Pretoria have been re-opened to be followed by the remaining lines in the next year.  "
"467",2022,"Ramaphosa","One of the greatest constraints on the technological development of our economy has been the unacceptable delay in the migration of broadcasting from analogue to digital.  "
"468",2022,"Ramaphosa","The switch-off of analogue transmission has been completed in a number of provinces.  "
"469",2022,"Ramaphosa","As I announced in the SoNA last year, the other provinces will move to digital signal by the end of March 2022.  "
"470",2022,"Ramaphosa","As part of this process, government will continue to subsidise low-income households so that they can access a set-top box and make the switch to digital TV.  "
"471",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our communications regulator, ICASA, will commence with the auctioning of the high frequency communications spectrum in about three weeks from now.  "
"472",2022,"Ramaphosa","This will unlock new spectrum for mobile telecommunications for the first time in over a decade.  "
"473",2022,"Ramaphosa","In addition, we will facilitate the rapid deployment of broadband infrastructure across all municipalities by establishing a standard model for the granting of municipal permissions.  "
"474",2022,"Ramaphosa","These reforms will revolutionise the country’s technological development, making faster broadband accesible to more people and reducing the costs of digital communications.  "
"475",2022,"Ramaphosa","The world over, the ability to attract skilled immigrants is the hallmark of a modern, thriving economy.  "
"476",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are therefore streamlining and modernising the visa application process to make it easier to travel to South Africa for tourism, business and work.  "
"477",2022,"Ramaphosa","As we committed last year, the eVisa system has now been launched in 14 countries, including China, India, Kenya and Nigeria.  "
"478",2022,"Ramaphosa","The revised Critical Skills List has been published for the first time since 2014, following detailed technical work and extensive consultations with business and labour. "
"479",2022,"Ramaphosa","The updated list reflects the skills that are in shortage today, to ensure that our immigration policy matches the demands of our economy.  "
"480",2022,"Ramaphosa","A comprehensive review of the work visa system is currently underway, led by a former Director-General of Home Affairs, Mr Mavuso Msimang.  "
"481",2022,"Ramaphosa","This review is exploring the possibility of new visa categories that could enable economic growth, such as a start-up Visa and a remote working visa.  "
"482",2022,"Ramaphosa","Water is the country’s most precious natural resource.  "
"483",2022,"Ramaphosa","It is vital to life, to development and to economic growth.  "
"484",2022,"Ramaphosa","That is why we have prioritised institutional reforms in this area to ensure future water security, investment in water resources and maintenance of existing assets.  "
"485",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have embarked on the process of institutional reform in capacitating the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) and reviewing water boards in as far as their mandates are concerned and ensuring that they serve municipalities in terms of the District Development Model (DDM).  "
"486",2022,"Ramaphosa","These reforms are being championed by the Minister of Water and Sanitation, who has visited every water source in the country.  "
"487",2022,"Ramaphosa","A comprehensive turnaround plan is being implemented to streamline the process for water use license applications. "
"488",2022,"Ramaphosa","The target is to clear the backlog of applications by June 2022 and to process 80% of all applications within 90 days during the next financial year.  "
"489",2022,"Ramaphosa","Legislation has been prepared for the establishment of the National Water Resources Infrastructure Agency, and will be published for public comment within the next month.  "
"490",2022,"Ramaphosa","The water quality monitoring system has been reinstated to improve enforcement of water standards at municipal level, and enable the DWS to intervene where water and sanitation services are failing.  "
"491",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will review the policy and regulatory framework for industrial hemp and cannabis to realise the huge potential for investment and job creation.  "
"492",2022,"Ramaphosa","While structural reforms are necessary for us to revive economic growth, they are not enough on their own.  "
"493",2022,"Ramaphosa","This year, we are undertaking far-reaching measures to unleash the potential of small businesses, micro businesses and informal businesses.  "
"494",2022,"Ramaphosa","These are the businesses that create the most jobs and provide the most opportunities for poor people to earn a living.  "
"495",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have started discussions with social partners as part of the social compact process to review labour market regulations for smaller businesses to enable them to hire more people, while continuing to protect workers’ rights.  "
"496",2022,"Ramaphosa","A new, redesigned loan guarantee scheme is being introduced to enable small businesses to bounce back from the pandemic and civic unrest.  "
"497",2022,"Ramaphosa","This new bounce-back scheme incorporates the lessons from the previous loan guarantee scheme.  "
"498",2022,"Ramaphosa","It will involve development finance institutions and non-bank SME providers in offering finance, expand the types of financing available and adjust eligibility criteria to encourage greater uptake.  "
"499",2022,"Ramaphosa","The National Treasury is working with industry stakeholders to finalise the scheme and will provide details soon.  "
"500",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are reviewing the Business Act, 1991 (Act 71 of 1991) – alongside a broader review of legislation that affects small, medium and small-enterprises (SMMEs) – to reduce the regulatory burden on informal businesses.  "
"501",2022,"Ramaphosa","There are too many regulations in this country that are unduly complicated, costly and difficult to comply with. "
"502",2022,"Ramaphosa","This prevents companies from growing and creating jobs.  "
"503",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are, therefore, working to improve the business environment for companies of all sizes through a dedicated capacity in The Presidency to reduce red tape.  "
"504",2022,"Ramaphosa","If we are to make progress in cutting unnecessary bureaucratic delays for businesses, we need dedicated capacity with the means to make changes.  "
"505",2022,"Ramaphosa","I have therefore appointed Mr Sipho Nkosi to head up a team in my office to cut red tape across government.  "
"506",2022,"Ramaphosa","Mr Nkosi has extensive experience in business, including as the CEO of Exxaro Resources, and is currently the chairperson of the Small Business Institute.  "
"507",2022,"Ramaphosa","The red tape team will identify priority reforms for the year ahead, including mechanisms to ensure government departments pay suppliers within the required 30 days.  "
"508",2022,"Ramaphosa","The team will also work with other departments and agencies to unblock specific obstacles to investment and business growth. "
"509",2022,"Ramaphosa","It will support current initiatives to simplify processes relating to property registration, cross-border trade and construction permits.  "
"510",2022,"Ramaphosa","Infrastructure is central to our economic reconstruction and recovery.  "
"511",2022,"Ramaphosa","Through innovative funding and improved technical capabilities, we have prioritised infrastructure projects to support economic growth and better livelihoods, especially in energy, roads and water management.  "
"512",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Infrastructure Fund is at the centre of this effort, with a R100 billion allocation from the fiscus over 10 years.  "
"513",2022,"Ramaphosa","The fund is now working with state entities to prepare a pipeline of projects with an investment value of approximately R96 billion in student accommodation, social housing, telecommunications, water and sanitation and transport.  "
"514",2022,"Ramaphosa","Several catalytic projects to the value of R21 billion are expected to start construction this year. "
"515",2022,"Ramaphosa","Of this, R2.6 billion is contributed by government and the balance from the private sector and developmental finance institutions.  "
"516",2022,"Ramaphosa","Government will make an initial investment of R1.8 billion in bulk infrastructure, which will unlock seven private sector projects to the value of R133 billion.  "
"517",2022,"Ramaphosa","For millions of South Africans in rural areas, roads and bridges provide access to markets, employment opportunities and social services.  "
"518",2022,"Ramaphosa","Yet, many children still have to brave overflowing rivers to reach schools and motorists have to battle impassable roads to reach the next town.  "
"519",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are therefore upscaling the Welisizwe Rural Bridges Programme to deliver 95 bridges a year from the current 14.  "
"520",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is the implementing agent of the Welisizwe programme, and has demonstrated the expertise of SANDF engineers in bridge construction.  "
"521",2022,"Ramaphosa","Earlier this week, I was in Thakgalane village Limpopo to launch a new road that is going to make a huge difference in the lives of neighbouring communities. "
"522",2022,"Ramaphosa","This road was constructed using block paving and other materials, which is a method that enables us to build durable roads faster and more cost-effectively.  "
"523",2022,"Ramaphosa","The rural roads programme will use labour intensive methods to construct or upgrade 685 kilometres of rural road over the next three years. "
"524",2022,"Ramaphosa","This social enterprise programme includes access roads in Limpopo and Eastern Cape, gravel to surface upgrades in the Free State and North West, and capacity and connectivity improvements in the Western Cape.  "
"525",2022,"Ramaphosa","Government has initiated the process of delivering the uMzimvubu Water Project.  "
"526",2022,"Ramaphosa","The project is made of the Ntabelanga Dam and Lalini Dam, irrigation infrastructure and hydo-electric plant, Ntabelanga water treatment works and bulk distribution infrastructure to reticulate to the neighboring communities.  "
"527",2022,"Ramaphosa","The closing date for the first of the two-stage procurement process is scheduled to close later this month, with the preferred bidder likely to be announced in September 2022.  "
"528",2022,"Ramaphosa","Government is introducing an innovative social infrastructure delivery mechanism to address issues that afflict the delivery of school infrastructure.  "
"529",2022,"Ramaphosa","The mechanism will address the speed, financing and funding, quality of delivery, mass employment and maintenance.  "
"530",2022,"Ramaphosa","The new delivery mechanism will introduce a Special Purpose Vehicle, working with prominent Development Finance Institutions and the private sector, to deliver school education infrastructure.  "
"531",2022,"Ramaphosa","This approach is being piloted in schools in the Northern Cape and Eastern Cape.  "
"532",2022,"Ramaphosa","Over the past year, government has built on its successful Hydrogen SA strategy to make major strides in positioning South Africa as a global leader in this new market.  "
"533",2022,"Ramaphosa","This includes the development of a Hydrogen Society Roadmap for the next 10 years as well as a Green Hydrogen Strategy for the Northern Cape, supporting the development of a green hydrogen pipeline worth around R270 billion.  "
"534",2022,"Ramaphosa","The damage caused by the theft of scrap metal and cable on our infrastructure like electricity, trains and other vital services is enormous. "
"535",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will take decisive steps this year both through improved law enforcement and by considering further measures to address the sale or export of such scrap metal.  "
"536",2022,"Ramaphosa","An important pillar of our ERRP is to revitalise our manufacturing base and create globally competitive export industries.  "
"537",2022,"Ramaphosa","In the past year, we launched new master plans in the steel industry, furniture and global business services.  "
"538",2022,"Ramaphosa","Through these plans, business, government and labour are working together to increase production and create more jobs in the sector.  "
"539",2022,"Ramaphosa","In the clothing industry, a number of retailers have announced ambitious localisation sourcing plans.  "
"540",2022,"Ramaphosa","One of these retailers, Foschini, kindly made the suit that I am wearing today at its new formal wear factory, Prestige Epping.  "
"541",2022,"Ramaphosa","Five years ago, more than 80% of all Foschini Group merchandise came from the East. "
"542",2022,"Ramaphosa","Today, nearly half of the merchandise is locally made.  "
"543",2022,"Ramaphosa","The genuine leather shoes I am wearing were made by members of the National Union of Leather and Allied Workers from Bolton Footwear in Cape Town and Dick Whittington Shoes in Pietermaritzburg.  "
"544",2022,"Ramaphosa","Nearly four years ago, we set ourselves a target of mobilising R1.2 trillion in new investment over five years.  "
"545",2022,"Ramaphosa","By the time of the third South Africa Investment Conference in November 2020, we had reached R776 billion in investment commitments.  "
"546",2022,"Ramaphosa","Next month, on the 24th of March, we will be holding the fourth South Africa Investment Conference in Johannesburg.  "
"547",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will showcase the many investment opportunities available as South Africa continues its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and report back on the progress of previous commitments.  "
"548",2022,"Ramaphosa","Following the resolutions of the African Union Summit over the past weekend, trading can now begin under the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement  South African companies are poised to play a key role in taking up the opportunities that this presents for preferential access to other African markets.  "
"549",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Free Trade agreement is about Africa taking charge of its destiny and growing its economies faster.  "
"550",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to pursue Africa’s health sovereignty, working with other African countries and international partners to support the strengthening of the continent’s capacity to respond to pandemics.  "
"551",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will increase our efforts to develop Africa’s ability to manufacture vaccines.  "
"552",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have made significant progress here in South Africa.  "
"553",2022,"Ramaphosa","We now have two South African companies – Aspen and Biovac – with contracts to produce COVID-19 vaccines. "
"554",2022,"Ramaphosa","Two additional vaccine projects have also been announced.  "
"555",2022,"Ramaphosa","In addition, we have full local production capability for ventilators, hand sanitisers, medical-grade face masks and gloves and therapeutic drugs and anaesthetics.  "
"556",2022,"Ramaphosa","This production capability worth many billions of rand of production annually, has been put in place in less than two years.  "
"557",2022,"Ramaphosa","South African products have been exported to other African countries, securing them vital supplies and expanding jobs for young South Africans.  "
"558",2022,"Ramaphosa","While we help existing industries to grow, we are also nurturing new opportunities for growth and jobs.  "
"559",2022,"Ramaphosa","Government and the private sector have worked closely together to grow the global business services sector from a small group of companies to one of the world’s leading players.  "
"560",2022,"Ramaphosa","The global business services sector is on track to create 500 000 new jobs over the next few years.  "
"561",2022,"Ramaphosa","The hemp and cannabis sector has the potential to create more than 130 000 new jobs.  "
"562",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are therefore streamlining the regulatory processes so that the hemp and cannabis sector can thrive like it is in other countries such as Lesotho.  "
"563",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our people in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and elsewhere are ready to farm with this age-old commodity and bring it to market in new and innovative forms.  "
"564",2022,"Ramaphosa","The social economy, including early childhood development, nursing, social work and community services, has significant potential not only to create jobs, but to provide vital services that communities need.  "
"565",2022,"Ramaphosa","Some of the country’s mature industries also have a lot to offer in revamping the industrial and manufacturing potential of our country.  "
"566",2022,"Ramaphosa","The agriculture sector has significant potential for job creation in crops such as citrus, table and dried grapes, subtropical fruit, avocadoes, berries and nuts.  "
"567",2022,"Ramaphosa","Masterplans in the sugar and poultry industries are contributing significantly to increased investment, improved production and transformation.  "
"568",2022,"Ramaphosa","To attract investors into the mining minerals needed in the new global economy, we will soon be finalising our mining exploration strategy.  "
"569",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to support the development of the upstream gas industry, as it holds huge potential for job creation and broader economic development.  "
"570",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will ensure that this is done in strict accordance with the environmental and other laws of our country, and that where there are differences, we work together to resolve them in the interest of our country and its people.  "
"571",2022,"Ramaphosa","We live in one of the regions of the world that is most affected by climate change.  "
"572",2022,"Ramaphosa","We frequently experience droughts, floods and other extreme weather events associated with global warming. "
"573",2022,"Ramaphosa","Recently floods have affected a number of provinces, including KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Eastern Cape.  "
"574",2022,"Ramaphosa","These have already caused enormous damage to infrastructure and livelihoods.  "
"575",2022,"Ramaphosa","In the last year, we have made important strides in the fight against climate change, and, at the same time, securing our economic competitiveness.  "
"576",2022,"Ramaphosa","For the first time, our climate targets are compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C.  "
"577",2022,"Ramaphosa","This is the goal that all countries agreed to as part of the Paris Climate Agreement, and is essential to prevent the worst effects of climate change.  "
"578",2022,"Ramaphosa","Since I established the Presidential Climate Commission a little more than a year ago, it has done much work to support a just transition to a sustainable, inclusive, resilient and low-carbon economy.  "
"579",2022,"Ramaphosa","At the international climate conference in Glasgow last November, South Africa struck a historic R131 billion deal with the European Union, France, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States.  "
"580",2022,"Ramaphosa","This first-of-its-kind partnership will involve repurposing and repowering some of the coal plants that are reaching the end of their lives, and creating new livelihoods for workers and communities most impacted by this change.  "
"581",2022,"Ramaphosa","To ensure that South Africa is able to derive the full benefit of this and other partnerships, I have appointed Mr Daniel Mminele, a former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, as Head of the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team to lead the mobilisation of funds for our just transition.  "
"582",2022,"Ramaphosa","Properly managed, the energy transition will benefit all.  "
"583",2022,"Ramaphosa","Renewable energy production will make electricity cheaper and more dependable, and will allow our industries to remain globally competitive.  "
"584",2022,"Ramaphosa","Investments in electric vehicles and hydrogen will equip South Africa to meet the global clean energy future.  "
"585",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will be able to expand our mining industry in strategic minerals that are crucial for clean energy, like platinum, vanadium, cobalt, copper, manganese and lithium.  "
"586",2022,"Ramaphosa","We also have a unique opportunity in green hydrogen, given our world-class solar and wind resources and local technology and expertise.  "
"587",2022,"Ramaphosa","All of these measures – from structural reforms to support for SMMEs, investments in infrastructure and the emergence of new sectors – will drive a turnaround in economic growth driven by the private sector growth over the coming years.  "
"588",2022,"Ramaphosa","We know, however, that even with the best business environment and much faster rates of economic growth, it will take time for the private sector to create enough jobs for the millions of South Africans who need them.  "
"589",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our intent is to leave no one behind.  "
"590",2022,"Ramaphosa","That is why we are expanding public and social employment.  "
"591",2022,"Ramaphosa","The first two phases of the Presidential Employment Stimulus programmes, which we launched in October 2020 have supported over 850 000 opportunities.  "
"592",2022,"Ramaphosa","More than 80 per cent of participants were young people, and over 60% were women.  "
"593",2022,"Ramaphosa","It has supported young women like Tracy Nkosi from Springs, who was employed as an education assistant at Welgedag Primary School, and who says this opportunity has motivated her to further her studies in the educational sphere.  "
"594",2022,"Ramaphosa","It has also supported Mama Nosipho Cekwana from Impendle in KwaZulu-Natal who used her farming input voucher to buy maize, manure and supplements for her livestock.     "
"595",2022,"Ramaphosa","The total number of direct beneficiaries will soon rise to over one million South Africans.  "
"596",2022,"Ramaphosa","This includes over half a million young people appointed as education assistants, making it the largest youth employment programme ever undertaken in our history.  "
"597",2022,"Ramaphosa","The employment stimulus will also enable the Department of Home Affairs to recruit 10 000 unemployed young people for the digitisation of paper records, enhancing their skills and contributing to the modernisation of citizen services.  "
"598",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Social Employment Fund will create a further 50 000 work opportunities using the capability of organisations beyond government, in areas such as urban agriculture, early childhood development, public art and tackling gender-based violence.  "
"599",2022,"Ramaphosa","In addition to expanding public employment, we are providing support to young people to prepare them for work and link them to opportunities.  "
"600",2022,"Ramaphosa","To encourage hiring by smaller businesses, we will be increasing the value and expanding the criteria for participation in the Employment Tax Incentive.  "
"601",2022,"Ramaphosa","For several years, this has been an effective way to encourage companies to hire new work seekers. "
"602",2022,"Ramaphosa","The changes to the incentive will make it easier for small businesses in particular to hire young people.  "
"603",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Minister of Finance will announce the details of these changes in the budget.  "
"604",2022,"Ramaphosa","We call on companies to support this effort, take up the incentive and give young people a place in the world of work.  "
"605",2022,"Ramaphosa","The SAYouth.mobi platform for young work seekers to access opportunities and support now has more than 2.3 million young South Africans registered.  "
"606",2022,"Ramaphosa","Of these over 600 000 have been placed into employment opportunities.  "
"607",2022,"Ramaphosa","A revitalised National Youth Service will recruit its first cohort of 50 000 young people during the next year, creating opportunities for young people to contribute to their communities, develop their skills and grow their employability.  "
"608",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Department of Higher Education and Training will place 10,000 unemployed TVET graduates in workplaces from April 2022.  "
"609",2022,"Ramaphosa","In preparing this SoNA, I was assisted by two young South Africans who are working as interns in The Presidency, Ms Naledi Malatji and Ms Kearabetswe Mabatle.  "
"610",2022,"Ramaphosa","They told me about the pain felt by young people who find themselves with a qualification, but are unemployed because of lack of experience.  "
"611",2022,"Ramaphosa","This forces many into jobs that have little or nothing to do with what they studied.  "
"612",2022,"Ramaphosa","All of the measures I have outlined are essential to provide young people with the work experience that they need to take their first step into the labour market.  "
"613",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are calling on the private sector to support these measures – and, wherever possible, to drop experience as a hiring requirement – to give as many young people as possible their first job.  "
"614",2022,"Ramaphosa","As we work to grow the economy and create jobs, we will expand support to poor families to ensure that no person in this country has to endure the pain and indignity of hunger.  "
"615",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our social protection system is among the greatest achievements of the democratic government, reaching more than 18 million people every month.  "
"616",2022,"Ramaphosa","Without this support, millions more people would live in dire poverty.  "
"617",2022,"Ramaphosa","Since the onset of COVID-19, the Social Relief of Distress Grant has provided support to more than 10 million unemployed people who were most vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic.  "
"618",2022,"Ramaphosa","Some people used that money to start businesses.  "
"619",2022,"Ramaphosa","Mr Thando Makhubu from Soweto received the R350 grant for seven months last year, and saved it to open an ice-cream store that now employs four people.  "
"620",2022,"Ramaphosa","Mr Lindokuhle Msomi, an unemployed TV producer from KwaMashu Hostel, saved the R350 grant he received for nine months to start a fast food stall and to support his family.  "
"621",2022,"Ramaphosa","As much as it has had a substantial impact, we must recognise that we face extreme fiscal constraints.  "
"622",2022,"Ramaphosa","A fiscal crisis would hurt the poor worst of all through the deterioration of the basic services on which they rely.  "
"623",2022,"Ramaphosa","Mindful of the proven benefits of the grant, we will extend the R350 grant for one further year, to the end of March 2023.  "
"624",2022,"Ramaphosa","During this time, we will engage in broad consultations and detailed technical work to identify the best options to replace this grant.  "
"625",2022,"Ramaphosa","Any future support must pass the test of affordability, and must not come at the expense of basic services or at the risk of unsustainable spending.  "
"626",2022,"Ramaphosa","It remains our ambition to establish a minimum level of support for those in greatest need.  "
"627",2022,"Ramaphosa","Expanding access to land is vital for our efforts to reduce hunger and provide people with meaningful livelihoods.  "
"628",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are moving ahead with land reform in terms of the Constitution, and anticipate the approval of the Expropriation Bill during this year.  "
"629",2022,"Ramaphosa","The establishment of the Agriculture and Land Reform Development Agency will be finalised this year.  "
"630",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure will finalise the transfer of 14 000 hectares of state land to the Housing Development Agency.  "
"631",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have enough arable land to support millions of thriving small-scale farmers in poultry, livestock, fruit and vegetables.  "
"632",2022,"Ramaphosa","Through the Presidential Employment Stimulus and the Solidarity Fund, over 100 000 farmers have already received input vouchers to expand their production.  "
"633",2022,"Ramaphosa","This scheme has proven to be effective and impactful.  "
"634",2022,"Ramaphosa","The agriculture sector has also recognised the importance of supporting small-scale farmers and integrating them into value chains.  "
"635",2022,"Ramaphosa","Through the sugar master plan, the industry has provided R225 million to over 12 000 small-scale sugar cane growers as part of a R1 billion commitment to support black farmers.  "
"636",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will be expanding the provision of input vouchers and calling on other sectors to join this effort, so that we can collectively reach up to 250 000 small-scale farmers this year.  "
"637",2022,"Ramaphosa","None of our efforts to revive our economy will succeed if we do not tackle the scourge of corruption once and for all.  "
"638",2022,"Ramaphosa","Since the beginning of the year, I have been provided with the first two parts of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture headed by Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo.  "
"639",2022,"Ramaphosa","While the definitive conclusion has yet to be delivered at the end of this month, the first two parts of the report make it plain that there was indeed ‘state capture’.  "
"640",2022,"Ramaphosa","This means that public institutions and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were infiltrated by a criminal network intent on looting public money for private gain.  "
"641",2022,"Ramaphosa","The reports have detailed the devastating effects of this criminal activity on South African Airways, Transnet, Denel, South African Revenue Service (SARS) and Government Communications.  "
"642",2022,"Ramaphosa","State capture had a direct and very concrete negative impact on the lives of all South Africans, but especially the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society.  "
"643",2022,"Ramaphosa","It has weakened the ability of the State to deliver services and to meet the expectations and constitutional rights of people.  "
"644",2022,"Ramaphosa","We must now do everything in our power to ensure that it never happens again.  "
"645",2022,"Ramaphosa","My responsibility is to ensure that the commission report is properly and carefully considered and then acted upon.  "
"646",2022,"Ramaphosa","By no later than 30 June, I will present a plan of action in response to the commission’s recommendations.  "
"647",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will, as the commission’s first report recommends, strengthen the system to protect whistle-blowers, who are a vital safeguard in the fight against corruption and who take huge personal risk in reporting wrongdoing.  "
"648",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are doing a detailed review of all applicable legislation and a comparative study of other jurisdictions to strengthen whistle-blower protection.  "
"649",2022,"Ramaphosa","The relevant law enforcement agencies are taking the necessary steps to address the immediate concern about the safety of whistle blowers.  "
"650",2022,"Ramaphosa","Many individuals and companies that the commission has found were responsible for state capture must now be held to account.  "
"651",2022,"Ramaphosa","I have every confidence that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will carry out the further investigations that the commission has recommended, and that it will bring the members of the criminal network that infiltrated government and captured the State swiftly to justice.  "
"652",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Investigating Directorate in the NPA is now poised to deliver on its crucial mandate, and a dedicated team has been established to pursue these cases.  "
"653",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will be appointing a new head of the Investigating Directorate following the departure of Adv Hermione Cronje from that position.  "
"654",2022,"Ramaphosa","An amendment to the State Capture Commission regulations in June 2020, empowered the sharing of information between the Commission and law enforcement agencies.  "
"655",2022,"Ramaphosa","This amendment also permitted the employment of the State Capture Commission personnel by law enforcement agencies.  "
"656",2022,"Ramaphosa","These empowering provisions has geared the Investigating Directorate to more effectively pursue the investigations emanating from the commission.  "
"657",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have gratefully acknowledged the offer of support from the private sector to assist in providing those skills which we lack in government to enable investigation and prosecution of crime.  "
"658",2022,"Ramaphosa","To ensure that the prosecuting authority remains true to its constitutional obligation and to ensure transparency, we are developing a framework for private sector cooperation that will be managed through National Treasury.  "
"659",2022,"Ramaphosa","There are also discussions underway with the Judiciary for the creation of special court rolls for state capture and corruption cases.  "
"660",2022,"Ramaphosa","While we have taken decisive steps to end the era of state capture, we know that the fight against corruption is far from over.  "
"661",2022,"Ramaphosa","Even as the country was suffering the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies and individuals were conspiring with public officials to defraud the government of billions of rand in COVID-related contracts.  "
"662",2022,"Ramaphosa","As soon as evidence emerged of this corruption we acted.  "
"663",2022,"Ramaphosa","We withdrew certain emergency procurement regulations, set up a fusion centre that brought together various law enforcement agencies, published the details of all COVID-related contracts online and instituted the most extensive investigation that the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has undertaken since its formation.  "
"664",2022,"Ramaphosa","In December, the SIU submitted its final report on its investigation into COVID-related contracts.  "
"665",2022,"Ramaphosa","As a result, 45 matters, with a combined value of R2.1 billion, have been enrolled with the Special Tribunal.  "
"666",2022,"Ramaphosa","The SIU has referred 224 government officials for disciplinary action and referred 386 cases for possible prosecution to the NPA.  "
"667",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Presidency has set up mechanisms to monitor implementation of the recommendations of the SIU and ensure that government departments and entities act against those who have violated regulations and broken the law.  "
"668",2022,"Ramaphosa","The fight against corruption will take on a new intensity thanks to the outcomes of the State Capture Commission, the strengthening of law enforcement agencies and the implementation of new anti-corruption practices in the public service.  "
"669",2022,"Ramaphosa","SOEs play a vital role in our economy.  "
"670",2022,"Ramaphosa","From water and roads, to energy and ports, to defence and aviation, these strategic assets are necessary to keep our country running.  "
"671",2022,"Ramaphosa","It is essential that we reverse their decline, and position them to contribute positively.  "
"672",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have therefore embarked on several immediate measures to restore these companies to health, at the same time as we undertake far-reaching reforms that will make our SOEs more efficient, competitive, accountable and sustainable.  "
"673",2022,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential SOE Council, which I appointed in 2020, has recommended that government adopt a centralised shareholder model for its key commercial state-owned companies. "
"674",2022,"Ramaphosa","This would separate the State’s ownership functions from its policy-making and regulatory functions, minimise the scope for political interference, introduce greater professionalism and manage state assets in a way that protects shareholder value.  "
"675",2022,"Ramaphosa","As part of this, preparatory work has begun for the establishment of a state-owned holding company to house strategic SOEs and to exercise coordinated shareholder oversight.  "
"676",2022,"Ramaphosa","To ensure that SOEs are effectively fulfilling their responsibilities, the Presidential SOE Council is preparing recommendations on SOEs to be retained, consolidated or disposed of.  "
"677",2022,"Ramaphosa","Any recommendations would be subject to extensive consultation with all stakeholders.  "
"678",2022,"Ramaphosa","We are taking steps to safeguard our democracy, protect our economic infrastructure and build safer communities for all.  "
"679",2022,"Ramaphosa","Earlier this week, we released the report of the expert panel into the civil unrest in July last year.  "
"680",2022,"Ramaphosa","The report paints a deeply disturbing picture of the capabilities of our security services and the structures that exist to coordinate their work.  "
"681",2022,"Ramaphosa","The report concludes that government’s initial handling of the July 2021 events was inept, police operational planning was poor, there was poor coordination between the state security and intelligence services, and police are not always embedded in the communities they serve.  "
"682",2022,"Ramaphosa","The expert panel said that if the violence has exposed anything it was the poverty and inequality that is the root cause of the desperation of the people of South Africa.  "
"683",2022,"Ramaphosa","The expert panel found that Cabinet must take overall responsibility for the events of July 2021.  "
"684",2022,"Ramaphosa","This is a responsibility that we acknowledge and accept.  "
"685",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will, as recommended by the panel, develop and drive a national response plan to address the weaknesses that the panel has identified.  "
"686",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will begin immediately by filling critical vacancies and addressing positions affected by suspensions in the State Security Agency and Crime Intelligence.  "
"687",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will soon be announcing leadership changes in a number of security agencies to strengthen our security structures.  "
"688",2022,"Ramaphosa","The staffing of the public order policing unit of the South African Police Service will be brought to an appropriate level, with appropriate training courses in place.  "
"689",2022,"Ramaphosa","The ongoing damage to and theft of economic infrastructure has damaged confidence and severely constrained economic growth, investment and job creation.  "
"690",2022,"Ramaphosa","At the same time, we need to confront the criminal gangs that invade construction sites and other business places to extort money from companies.  "
"691",2022,"Ramaphosa","This requires a focused and coordinated response.  "
"692",2022,"Ramaphosa","Government has therefore established specialise multi-disciplinary units to address economic sabotage, extortion at construction sites and vandalism of infrastructure.  "
"693",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will make resources available to recruit and train an additional 12 000 new police personnel to ensure that the South African Police Service urgently gets the capacity it needs.  "
"694",2022,"Ramaphosa","Another area of immediate attention will be the re-establishment of community policing forums to improve relations and coordination between local police and residents of the areas they serve.  "
"695",2022,"Ramaphosa","It is clear from the observations of the expert panel that we need to take a more inclusive approach to assessing the threats to our country’s security and determining the necessary responses.  "
"696",2022,"Ramaphosa","I am calling on all South Africans through their various formations to participate in developing our National Security Strategy.  "
"697",2022,"Ramaphosa","I will be approaching Parliament’s presiding officers to request that Parliament plays a key role in facilitating inclusive processes of consultation.  "
"698",2022,"Ramaphosa","The security services have been tasked by the National Security Council to urgently develop implementation plans that address the range of recommendations made by the expert panel.  "
"699",2022,"Ramaphosa","These measures will go a long way to address the serious concerns about the breakdown of law and order in society.  "
"700",2022,"Ramaphosa","This year, we are intensifying the fight against gender-based violence and femicide through implementation of the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide, and other measures to promote the empowerment of women.  "
"701",2022,"Ramaphosa","Earlier this month, I signed into law three new pieces of legislation, which has strengthened the criminal justice system, promoting accountability across the State and supporting survivors.  "
"702",2022,"Ramaphosa","The implementation of this legislation will go a long way to ensuring that cases are successfully prosecuted, that survivors are protected and that there are more effective deterrents in place.  "
"703",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have made significant progress in reducing the backlog in DNA processing, reducing it from 210 000 exhibits in April 2021 to around 58 000 at present.  "
"704",2022,"Ramaphosa","However, the fight against gender-based violence will never be won unless, as society, we mobilise all formations and all citizens behind a sustained programme of social action.  "
"705",2022,"Ramaphosa","As the COVID-19 pandemic has starkly demonstrated, a nation’s health is inextricably linked with its economic progress and social development.  "
"706",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will therefore continue with the work underway to ensure universal health coverage for everyone in South Africa, regardless of their ability to pay.  "
"707",2022,"Ramaphosa","While public hearings on the National Health  (NHI) Bill are continuing in Parliament, much progress is being made in preparing for the introduction of NHI.  "
"708",2022,"Ramaphosa","More than 59 million people are registered in the Health Patient Registration System.  "
"709",2022,"Ramaphosa","By September 2021, more than 56 000 additional health workers had been recruited and more than 46 000 community health workers integrated into the public health system.  "
"710",2022,"Ramaphosa","For the last two years, the education of our children and young people has been severely disrupted.  "
"711",2022,"Ramaphosa","As we return to normal educational activity, we will work harder to ensure that all learners and students get the quality education they need and deserve.  "
"712",2022,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Government must work for the people.  "
"713",2022,"Ramaphosa","That is why our foremost priority is to build a capable, ethical and developmental state.  "
"714",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will soon be finalising a framework for the professionalisation of the public service.  "
"715",2022,"Ramaphosa","This will include tighter measures for recruitment of public servants, continuous professional development through the National School of Government and partnerships between state bodies, professional associations and universities.  "
"716",2022,"Ramaphosa","Lifestyle audits are already being implemented across the Public Service.  "
"717",2022,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will continue with the implementation of the DDM.  "
"718",2022,"Ramaphosa","This model brings all three spheres of government together with other social partners in every district to grow inclusive local economies and improve the lives of citizens.  "
"719",2022,"Ramaphosa","In particular, the DDM facilitates integrated planning and budgeting across spheres of government and improves integration of national projects at a district level.  "
"720",2022,"Ramaphosa","While there are many parts of the state that require much work, there are institutions that continue to serve the people of this country effectively and efficiently.  "
"721",2022,"Ramaphosa","One such institution is the SARS, which will be 25 years old this year.  "
"722",2022,"Ramaphosa","While SARS was badly damaged by state capture, it has made remarkable progress in restoring its integrity, credibility and performance.  "
"723",2022,"Ramaphosa","Since its formation, SARS has collected some R16 trillion for the country’s social and economic development. "
"724",2022,"Ramaphosa","This revenue has enabled government to improve the lives of millions through the provision of healthcare, education, social grants and other basic services.  "
"725",2022,"Ramaphosa","A capable state is not only about the quality of public servants and the efficiency of institutions.  "
"726",2022,"Ramaphosa","It is also, fundamentally, about how citizens are empowered to participate.  "
"727",2022,"Ramaphosa","We must work together to ensure that platforms like schools governing bodies and community policing forums are more active and inclusive.  "
"728",2022,"Ramaphosa","A vibrant civil society is crucial for a capable state and for development.  "
"729",2022,"Ramaphosa","We will therefore be working with social partners to convene the long-awaited social sector summit.  "
"730",2022,"Ramaphosa","This summit will seek to improve the interface between the state and civil society and address the challenges that non-governmental organisations and community-based organisations face.  "
"731",2022,"Ramaphosa","Our country has suffered several damaging blows in recent times.  "
"732",2022,"Ramaphosa","A confluence of forces, many of them outside of our control, has brought us to where we are now.  "
"733",2022,"Ramaphosa","We face steep and daunting challenges.  "
"734",2022,"Ramaphosa","Indeed, we are engaged in a battle for the soul of this country.  "
"735",2022,"Ramaphosa","But there can be no doubt that we will win.  "
"736",2022,"Ramaphosa","I ask every South African to rally together in our fight against corruption, in our fight to create jobs, in our fight to achieve a more just and equal society.  "
"737",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have faced many crises in our past, and we have overcome them.  "
"738",2022,"Ramaphosa","We have been confronted with difficult choices, and we have made them.  "
"739",2022,"Ramaphosa","In trying times, we have shown courage and resilience  Time and time again, we have pulled ourselves back from the brink of despair and inspired hope, renewal and progress.  "
"740",2022,"Ramaphosa","Now, we must do so again.  "
"741",2022,"Ramaphosa","Let us forge a new consensus to confront a new reality, a consensus that unites us behind our shared determination to reform our economy and rebuild our institutions.  "
"742",2022,"Ramaphosa","Let us get to work.  "
"743",2022,"Ramaphosa","Let us rebuild our country.  "
"744",2022,"Ramaphosa","And let us leave no one behind.  "
"745",2022,"Ramaphosa","I thank you."
"746",2021,"Ramaphosa"," State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Parliament, Cape Town Speaker of the National Assembly (NA), Ms Thandi Modise, Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Mr Amos Masondo, Deputy President David Mabuza, Former President Thabo Mbeki and Mrs Mbeki, Former Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Former Deputy President Baleka Mbete, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the Judiciary, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Honourable members of the NA, Honourable members of the NCOP, Dean of the European Region, representing the diplomatic corps, His Excellency, Mr Beka Dvali,  Distinguished guests, Fellow South Africans,  On this day, 31 years ago, President Nelson Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison a free person, a living embodiment of the resilience and courage of the South African people.  "
"747",2021,"Ramaphosa","For nearly 40 million years, an extraordinary ecosystem has existed here at the southernmost tip of our continent.  "
"748",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Fynbos Biome, which stretches across the Cape, has among the most distinctive features of any plants found on earth.   "
"749",2021,"Ramaphosa","It can adapt to dry, hot summers and cold rainy winters. "
"750",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is wondrous in its diversity.  "
"751",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our national flower, the Protea, is a species of fynbos.   "
"752",2021,"Ramaphosa","When I opened the third National Investment Conference last year, I spoke of the Protea's unique properties that in so many ways resemble our national character.  "
"753",2021,"Ramaphosa","What is most unique and special about fynbos is that to be sustainable and survive, it needs fire.  "
"754",2021,"Ramaphosa","At least once every twenty years, fynbos must burn at extremely high temperatures to allow the ecosystem to be rejuvenated and grow afresh.  "
"755",2021,"Ramaphosa","Throughout the summer, the burned foliage lies desolate. "
"756",2021,"Ramaphosa","But when the autumn rains return, the seeds germinate, and its life cycle begins all over again.   "
"757",2021,"Ramaphosa","The mountains bloom with new life as plants which once seemed lost grow back even stronger than before.  "
"758",2021,"Ramaphosa","We, the people of South Africa, have over the past year experienced a terrible hardship.  "
"759",2021,"Ramaphosa","Like a wildfire that sweeps across the mountainous ranges where the fynbos grows, a deadly pandemic has swept across the world, leaving devastation in its path.  "
"760",2021,"Ramaphosa","And yet, like the hardy fynbos of our native land, we too have proven to be resilient in many ways.  "
"761",2021,"Ramaphosa","For three centuries, we were victims of oppression, dispossession and injustice.   "
"762",2021,"Ramaphosa","And for three centuries, we resisted.  "
"763",2021,"Ramaphosa","The flames of injustice may have scarred us, but they did not consume us.  "
"764",2021,"Ramaphosa","The rains of democracy brought rejuvenation and the birth of a new nation.  "
"765",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have risen time and time again from the depths of darkness to herald a new day.  "
"766",2021,"Ramaphosa","As we look on the grave damage that this disease has caused, we know that like the fynbos, like all those who have walked this land before us, we will rise again.  "
"767",2021,"Ramaphosa","Nearly a year has passed since South Africa saw its first case of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.  "
"768",2021,"Ramaphosa","Since then, nearly one-and-a-half million people in our country are known to have been infected by the virus.  "
"769",2021,"Ramaphosa","More than 45 000 people are known to have died.  "
"770",2021,"Ramaphosa","Beyond these statistics lies a human story of tragedy and pain.  "
"771",2021,"Ramaphosa","There is no family, no community and no place of work that has not lost someone they knew, worked with and loved.   "
"772",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is also a story of courage and resilience.   "
"773",2021,"Ramaphosa","The resilience of the hospital worker who – day after day, night after night – goes to work to save lives, knowing that they, themselves, are at risk of infection.  "
"774",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is a wonderful account of the courage of the police officer, the soldier, the essential worker, the carer and all those on the frontline, who have kept our country safe, our people fed and our economy going.  "
"775",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is a story of solidarity and compassion.  "
"776",2021,"Ramaphosa","Of a nation that has stood together to confront COVID-19 in ways not seen since the early days of our democracy.  "
"777",2021,"Ramaphosa","More than anything else, this crisis has revealed the true character of our remarkable nation.   "
"778",2021,"Ramaphosa","It has revealed a spirit of the people who refused to be defeated.   "
"779",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is this South African spirit that must drive our resolve to build a new and more equal economy and a better, more just society.  "
"780",2021,"Ramaphosa","The year ahead must be a time for change, for progress and for rebirth.   "
"781",2021,"Ramaphosa","It must be a year in which we rise.  "
"782",2021,"Ramaphosa","This is no ordinary year, and this is no ordinary SoNA.  "
"783",2021,"Ramaphosa","I will therefore, focus this evening on the foremost, overriding priorities of 2021.  "
"784",2021,"Ramaphosa","First, we must defeat the coronavirus pandemic.  "
"785",2021,"Ramaphosa","Second, we must accelerate our economic recovery.  "
"786",2021,"Ramaphosa","Third, we must implement economic reforms to create sustainable jobs and drive inclusive growth.  "
"787",2021,"Ramaphosa","And finally, we must fight corruption and strengthen the State.  "
"788",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the coming weeks, we will address the other important elements of government’s programme for the year.  "
"789",2021,"Ramaphosa","Fundamental to our nation’s recovery is an unrelenting and comprehensive response to overcome the coronavirus.  "
"790",2021,"Ramaphosa","South Africa has just emerged from the second wave of infections since COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March last year.  "
"791",2021,"Ramaphosa","Driven by a new variant of the virus, this second wave was more severe and cost many more lives than the first wave.  "
"792",2021,"Ramaphosa","Nevertheless, the human cost could have been far greater.  "
"793",2021,"Ramaphosa","Had we not moved quickly to restrict movement and activity, had we not prepared our health facilities, had South Africans not observed the basic health protocols, the devastation caused by this virus could have been far worse.  "
"794",2021,"Ramaphosa","This year, we must do everything in our means to contain and overcome this pandemic.  "
"795",2021,"Ramaphosa","This means intensifying our prevention efforts and strengthening our health system.  "
"796",2021,"Ramaphosa","It also means that we must undertake a massive vaccination programme to save lives and dramatically reduce infections across the population.  "
"797",2021,"Ramaphosa","Earlier this week, we were informed that one of the vaccines that we had procured, the AstraZeneca vaccine, offers minimal protection from mild to moderate infection by the new variant known as 501Y.v2.  "
"798",2021,"Ramaphosa","This is according to early findings of a study by our scientists and researchers.  "
"799",2021,"Ramaphosa","We applaud these scientists for leading this research and providing new evidence that is vital for guiding our response.  "
"800",2021,"Ramaphosa","Since this variant is now the dominant variant in our country, these findings have significant implications for the pace, design and sequencing of our vaccine programme.  "
"801",2021,"Ramaphosa","While it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment.  "
"802",2021,"Ramaphosa","The first phase of our vaccination programme, which is targeted at health and other frontline workers, will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.   "
"803",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have secured nine million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.  "
"804",2021,"Ramaphosa","The first batch, of 80 000 doses, will arrive in the country next week.  "
"805",2021,"Ramaphosa","Further consignments will arrive over the next four weeks, totalling 500 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines.  "
"806",2021,"Ramaphosa","All provinces have rollout plans in place as the first vaccines come through.   "
"807",2021,"Ramaphosa","I wish to thank all provinces for their level of preparedness for this massive undertaking that we are about to embark upon.  "
"808",2021,"Ramaphosa","In addition, we have secured 12 million vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility.  "
"809",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will be complemented by other vaccines that are available to South Africa through the African Union’s (AU) African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team Facility.  "
"810",2021,"Ramaphosa","Pfizer has committed 20 million vaccine doses, commencing with deliveries at the end of the first quarter.  "
"811",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are continuing our engagements with all the vaccine manufacturers to ensure that we secure sufficient quantities of vaccines that are suitable to our conditions.  "
"812",2021,"Ramaphosa","The health and safety of our people remains our paramount concern.   "
"813",2021,"Ramaphosa","All medication imported into the country is monitored, evaluated, investigated, inspected and registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority.   "
"814",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to use the science-driven approach that has served us well since the earliest days of the pandemic.   "
"815",2021,"Ramaphosa","The success of the vaccination programme will rely on active collaboration between all sectors of society.   "
"816",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are greatly encouraged by the active involvement of business, labour, the health industry and medical schemes, in particular, in preparing for this mass vaccination drive.  "
"817",2021,"Ramaphosa","As we have overcome before, we will overcome again and rise.  "
"818",2021,"Ramaphosa","But it is not just this disease that we must defeat.  "
"819",2021,"Ramaphosa","We must overcome poverty, hunger, joblessness and inequality.  "
"820",2021,"Ramaphosa","We must overcome a legacy of exclusion and dispossession that continues to impoverish our people, and which this pandemic has severely worsened.  "
"821",2021,"Ramaphosa","When I delivered the SoNA in this House last year, none of us could have imagined how – within a matter of weeks – our country and our world would have changed so dramatically.  "
"822",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our plans had to be adapted in response to a global emergency.  "
"823",2021,"Ramaphosa","Budgets had to be reprioritised and many programmes had to be deferred.  "
"824",2021,"Ramaphosa","Over the past year, South Africa has experienced a sharp decline in growth and a significant increase in unemployment.  "
"825",2021,"Ramaphosa","Poverty is on the rise. "
"826",2021,"Ramaphosa","Inequality is deepening.  "
"827",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the third quarter of 2020, our economy was 6% smaller than it was in the last quarter of 2019.   "
"828",2021,"Ramaphosa","There were 1,7 million fewer people employed in the third quarter of 2020 than there were in the first quarter, before the pandemic struck.   "
"829",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 30,8%.   "
"830",2021,"Ramaphosa","As a result of the relief measures that we implemented and the phased reopening of the economy, we expect to see a strong recovery in employment by the end of the year.  "
"831",2021,"Ramaphosa","As we worked to contain the spread of the virus, we also had to take extraordinary measures to support ordinary South Africans, assist businesses in distress and protect people’s livelihoods.  "
"832",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Social and Economic Relief Package that we introduced in April last year is the largest intervention of its kind in our history.  "
"833",2021,"Ramaphosa","It identified measures worth a total of R500 billion – or about 10% of our gross domestic product – to provide cash directly to the poorest households, to provide wage support to workers and to provide various forms of relief to struggling businesses.  "
"834",2021,"Ramaphosa","A total of 18 million people, or close to one-third of the population, received additional grant payments through these relief measures.  "
"835",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is estimated that this grant lifted more than five million people above the food poverty line, helping to alleviate hunger in a moment of great crisis.  "
"836",2021,"Ramaphosa","To date, more than R57 billion in wage support has been paid to over 4,5 million workers through the special Unemployment Insurance Fund Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS).  "
"837",2021,"Ramaphosa","More than R1,3 billion has been provided in support mainly for small- and medium-sized businesses.  "
"838",2021,"Ramaphosa","In addition, over R70 billion in tax relief was extended to businesses in distress.   "
"839",2021,"Ramaphosa","Around R18,9 billion in loans have been approved for 13 000 businesses through the Loan Guarantee Scheme.  "
"840",2021,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  It is nearly four months since I stood here before a joint sitting of this Parliament to present to the nation the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.  "
"841",2021,"Ramaphosa","This evening, we stand here not to make promises but to report on progress in the implementation of the recovery plan and the priority actions we must take to restore growth and create jobs.  "
"842",2021,"Ramaphosa","Since the launch of the plan, we have focused on four priority interventions:  a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country, a massive increase in local production, an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods, and the rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity. "
"843",2021,"Ramaphosa","We announced that we would be embarking on a massive rollout of infrastructure throughout the country.  "
"844",2021,"Ramaphosa","We knew that to achieve this objective we would need to steadily rebuild technical skills within government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects.   "
"845",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340 billion in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications.  "
"846",2021,"Ramaphosa","Construction has started and progress is being made on a number of these projects.  "
"847",2021,"Ramaphosa","Since the announcement of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, we have launched two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to almost 68 000 households in the Gauteng province.   "
"848",2021,"Ramaphosa","Similar human settlements projects are planned in other provinces.  "
"849",2021,"Ramaphosa","Two years ago, I spoke about the dream of building new cities that will enable us to make a break with apartheid’s spatial development.   "
"850",2021,"Ramaphosa","New post-apartheid cities are being conceptualised in a number of places in our country.   "
"851",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making.   "
"852",2021,"Ramaphosa","The draft masterplan for this smart city – which will become home to between 350 000 to 500 000 people within the next decade – was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment.   "
"853",2021,"Ramaphosa","Progress is being made on several major water infrastructure projects.  "
"854",2021,"Ramaphosa","These include Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Project, and the uMkhomazi Water Project.   "
"855",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies roads projects worth R19 billion covering the spine of the South African road network.  "
"856",2021,"Ramaphosa","Work is underway to finalise finance structuring for these projects.  "
"857",2021,"Ramaphosa","Resources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the major N1, N2 and N3 highways.   "
"858",2021,"Ramaphosa","These infrastructure projects will lead to the revival of the construction industry and the creation of much-needed jobs.  "
"859",2021,"Ramaphosa","The R100 billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation.  "
"860",2021,"Ramaphosa","This fund will blend resources from the fiscus with financing from the private sector and development institutions.  "
"861",2021,"Ramaphosa","Its approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied and includes the Student Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student beds.   "
"862",2021,"Ramaphosa","Another approved project is SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, hospitals, police stations and other government facilities.   "
"863",2021,"Ramaphosa","The second priority intervention of the recovery plan is to support a massive increase in local production and to make South African exports globally competitive.  "
"864",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will encourage greater investment by the private sector in productive activity.  "
"865",2021,"Ramaphosa","Key to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local.  "
"866",2021,"Ramaphosa","This commitment should lead to increased local production, which will lead to the revival of our manufacturing industry.  "
"867",2021,"Ramaphosa","All social partners that participated in the development of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, as part of our social compact, have agreed to work together to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years.  "
"868",2021,"Ramaphosa","They have identified 42 products – ranging from edible oils to furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel products and green economy inputs – that can be sourced locally.  "
"869",2021,"Ramaphosa","If we achieve our target, we will significantly expand our productive economy, potentially returning more than R200 billion to the country’s annual output.  "
"870",2021,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we undertook to create a larger market for small businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).   "
"871",2021,"Ramaphosa","As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of global value chains, we have been able to speed up this initiative as the local supply chains became open for locally manufactured products.   "
"872",2021,"Ramaphosa","To this end, Cabinet approved the SMME-Focused Localisation Policy Framework which identified the 1 000 products.   "
"873",2021,"Ramaphosa","Furthermore, the departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and international markets.   "
"874",2021,"Ramaphosa","These efforts are supported by robust manufacturing support programmes.    "
"875",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the SoNA last year, I said that our vision for industrialisation is underpinned by sector master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries.   "
"876",2021,"Ramaphosa","Four master plans that have been completed and signed to date – which are part of the social compact between labour, business, government and communities – have already had an impact in their respective industries.  "
"877",2021,"Ramaphosa","Through the implementation of the Poultry Master Plan, the industry has invested R800 million to upgrade production.  "
"878",2021,"Ramaphosa","South Africa now produces an additional one million chickens every week.  "
"879",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Sugar Master Plan was signed during the lockdown, with a commitment from large users of sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers.   "
"880",2021,"Ramaphosa","Through the implementation of the plan, last year saw a rise in local production and a decline in imported sugar, creating stability for an industry which employs some 85 000 workers.   "
"881",2021,"Ramaphosa","Support for black small-scale farmers is being stepped up, with a large beverage producer committing to expand their procurement sharply.   "
"882",2021,"Ramaphosa","Since the signing of the Clothing, Textile, Footwear and Leather Masterplan in November 2019, the industry has invested more than half a billion rand to expand local manufacturing facilities, including SMMEs.  "
"883",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have worked closely with the auto sector to help it weather the pandemic.   "
"884",2021,"Ramaphosa","By the end of the year, the sector had recovered around 70% of its normal annual production, in difficult circumstances.   "
"885",2021,"Ramaphosa","Last week, the Ford Motor Company announced a R16 billion investment to expand their manufacturing facility in Tshwane for the next generation Ford Ranger bakkie.   "
"886",2021,"Ramaphosa","This investment will support the growth of around 12 small and medium enterprises in automotive component manufacturing.  "
"887",2021,"Ramaphosa","Nearly half of the procurement spend on construction of the bulk earthworks and top structure at the Tshwane Special Economic Zone during this phase is expected to be allocated for SMMEs, an amount equal to R1,7 billion in procurement opportunities.  "
"888",2021,"Ramaphosa","Toyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility to start production of the first generation of hybrid electric vehicles to come off a South African assembly line.  "
"889",2021,"Ramaphosa","This follows investment announcements by Nissan, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu in expanded production facilities, all of which cement South Africa’s position as a global player in auto manufacturing.  "
"890",2021,"Ramaphosa","This year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent.  "
"891",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will be part of our concerted effort to boost the manufacturing sector.  "
"892",2021,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into operation on 1 January, following the adoption of the Johannesburg Declaration by the AU.  "
"893",2021,"Ramaphosa","The AfCFTA provides a platform for South African businesses to expand into markets across the continent, and for South Africa to position itself as a gateway to the continent.  "
"894",2021,"Ramaphosa","To address the deep inequalities in our society, we must accelerate the implementation of broad-based black economic empowerment policies on ownership, control and management of the economy.  "
"895",2021,"Ramaphosa","Last year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to their workers.   "
"896",2021,"Ramaphosa","In November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.   "
"897",2021,"Ramaphosa","Even under difficult economic circumstances, the investment conference managed to raise some R108 billion in additional investment commitments.   "
"898",2021,"Ramaphosa","Together with investment confirmed from the two previous conferences, we have now received R773 billion in investment commitments towards our five-year target of R1,2 trillion.  "
"899",2021,"Ramaphosa","Firms have reported that some R183 billion of these investments has already flowed into projects that benefit the South African economy.  "
"900",2021,"Ramaphosa","This shows that our country is still an attractive investment destination for both local and offshore companies.  "
"901",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have worked to facilitate investment by increasing the ease of doing business, including making it easier to start a business.   "
"902",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the past year, more than 125 000 new companies were registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration in just a matter of hours from the comfort of their homes or offices.   "
"903",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are making it easier for business to do business.  "
"904",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our third priority intervention is an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods.  "
"905",2021,"Ramaphosa","The largest numbers of jobs will be created by the private sector in a number of industries as the economy recovers.   "
"906",2021,"Ramaphosa","We continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to create a more conducive environment for them to be able to create jobs.   "
"907",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our compact with the private sector is underpinned by a clear commitment to grow our economy and to create jobs.  "
"908",2021,"Ramaphosa","However, the public sector has a responsibility to stimulate job creation; both through its policies and through direct job creation opportunities.  "
"909",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant expansions of public and social employment in South Africa’s history.   "
"910",2021,"Ramaphosa","By the end of January 2021, over 430 000 opportunities were already supported through the stimulus.  "
"911",2021,"Ramaphosa","A further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process.  "
"912",2021,"Ramaphosa","These opportunities are in areas like education, arts and culture, global business services, early childhood development (ECD), and small-scale and subsistence farming.  "
"913",2021,"Ramaphosa","It involves environmental programmes such as the clearing of alien trees, wetland rehabilitation, fire prevention, and cleaning and greening across all municipalities.  "
"914",2021,"Ramaphosa","These programmes are about real lives and real livelihoods.  "
"915",2021,"Ramaphosa","Nearly half a million people are now receiving an income, developing new skills and contributing to their community and the country’s economy.  "
"916",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to support employment for as long as it is necessary while the labour market recovers, even as we work to promote stronger and more resilient growth in the private sector.  "
"917",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the SoNA last year, in response to the huge challenge our country faces of youth unemployment, I announced that the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development would provide grant funding and business support to 1 000 young entrepreneurs within 100 days.  "
"918",2021,"Ramaphosa","While the programme had to be put on hold due to the coronavirus restrictions, it nevertheless managed to reach its target of 1 000 businesses by International Youth Day on 12 August 2020.  "
"919",2021,"Ramaphosa","This provides a firm foundation for our efforts to support 15 000 start-ups by 2024.  "
"920",2021,"Ramaphosa","Last year, we said we would establish the National Pathway Management Network to provide support and opportunities to young people across the country.  "
"921",2021,"Ramaphosa","I want to encourage every young South African to join the more than 1,2 million people who are already in the network, and take their next steps to a better future.  "
"922",2021,"Ramaphosa","Of the many hardships our people had to experience last year, schooling disruption placed a huge burden on learners, teachers and families.  "
"923",2021,"Ramaphosa","Despite this, they persevered.  "
"924",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is our priority for this year to regain lost time and improve educational outcomes, from the early years through to high school and post-school education and training.  "
"925",2021,"Ramaphosa","The fourth priority intervention of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is to rapidly expand energy generation capacity.  "
"926",2021,"Ramaphosa","Restoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective.  "
"927",2021,"Ramaphosa","Eskom has been restructured into three separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution.  "
"928",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will lay the foundations for an efficient, modern and competitive energy system.  "
"929",2021,"Ramaphosa","Eskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its coal fleet.  "
"930",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on the fiscus.   "
"931",2021,"Ramaphosa","This requires a review of the tariff path to ensure that it reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of municipal debt.  "
"932",2021,"Ramaphosa","In December 2020, government and its social partners signed the historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we must take, collectively and as individual constituencies, to meet the country’s energy needs now and into the future.  "
"933",2021,"Ramaphosa","Over the last year, we have taken action to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:  The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will soon be announcing the successful bids for 2 000 megawatts (MW) of emergency power.  "
"934",2021,"Ramaphosa","The necessary regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers. "
"935",2021,"Ramaphosa","Systems are being put in place to support qualifying municipalities. "
"936",2021,"Ramaphosa","Government will soon be initiating the procurement of an additional 11 800 MW of power from renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage and coal in line with the Integrated Resource Plan 2019. "
"937",2021,"Ramaphosa","Despite this work, Eskom estimates that, without additional capacity, there will be an electricity supply shortfall of between 4 000 and 6 000 MW over the next five years, as old coal-fired power stations reach their end of life.  "
"938",2021,"Ramaphosa","As part of the measures to address this shortfall, we will in the coming weeks issue a request for proposals for 2 600 MW from wind and solar energy as part of Bid Window 5.   "
"939",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will be followed by another bid window in August 2021.  "
"940",2021,"Ramaphosa","Recent analysis suggests that easing the licensing requirements for new embedded generation projects could unlock up to 5 000 MW of additional capacity and help to ease the impact of load shedding.  "
"941",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will therefore amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for embedded generation.  "
"942",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will include consultation among key stakeholders on the level at which the new threshold should be set and the finalisation of the necessary enabling frameworks.  "
"943",2021,"Ramaphosa","Eskom has already started work to expedite its commercial and technical processes to allow this additional capacity onto the grid without undue delay.  "
"944",2021,"Ramaphosa","As we mobilise all of the resources at our disposal to support economic recovery, we cannot lose sight of the threat that climate change poses to our environmental health, socioeconomic development and economic growth.   "
"945",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are, therefore, working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.   "
"946",2021,"Ramaphosa","Eskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050 and to increase its renewable capacity.   "
"947",2021,"Ramaphosa","Eskom will be looking to partner with investors to repurpose and repower part of its coal fleet.   "
"948",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will be done in a way that stimulates investment, local economic activity and local manufacturing, as part of a just transition.  "
"949",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the first time this month.   "
"950",2021,"Ramaphosa","The commission will work on a plan for a just transition to a low-carbon economy and climate resilient society.   "
"951",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will not achieve higher rates of growth and employment if we do not implement structural economic reforms.  "
"952",2021,"Ramaphosa","These reforms are necessary to reduce costs and barriers to entry, increase competition, stimulate new investment and create space for new entrants in the market.  "
"953",2021,"Ramaphosa","This work is being driven through Operation Vulindlela, which involves a team in the National Treasury and the President’s office.  "
"954",2021,"Ramaphosa","Operation Vulindlela is focusing on reforms in the electricity, water, telecommunications and transport sectors, as well as reforms to our visa and immigration regime.  "
"955",2021,"Ramaphosa","The completion of digital migration is vital to our ability to effectively harness the enormous opportunities presented by technological change.  "
"956",2021,"Ramaphosa","After many delays, we will begin the phased switch-off of our analogue television transmitters from next month.  "
"957",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is anticipated that this process, which will be done province-by-province, will be completed by the end of March 2022.  "
"958",2021,"Ramaphosa","The process for the licensing of high-demand spectrum is at an advanced stage.  "
"959",2021,"Ramaphosa","We hope that the ongoing litigation on the licensing matter will provide legal certainty and will not unduly delay the spectrum auction process.   "
"960",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the water sector, we are working through Operation Vulindlela to ensure that water license applications are finalised within the revised timeframe of 90 days; and to revive the Green Drop and Blue Drop programmes to strengthen water quality monitoring.  "
"961",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will finalise and implement the revised Raw Water Pricing Strategy, and accelerate the establishment of a national water resources infrastructure agency.  "
"962",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our ability to compete in global markets depends on the efficiency of our ports and rail network.  "
"963",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are repositioning Durban as a hub port for the Southern Hemisphere and developing Ngqura as the container terminal of choice.  "
"964",2021,"Ramaphosa","The rail corridor from Gauteng is being extended to enable the export of vehicles through Port Elizabeth.   "
"965",2021,"Ramaphosa","These are crucial steps to move freight from road to rail and increase the competitiveness of the rail system.  "
"966",2021,"Ramaphosa","Work is underway with the relevant departments to reform our visa and immigration regime to attract skills and grow the tourism sector.  "
"967",2021,"Ramaphosa","As international travel starts to recover in the wake of COVID-19, we will undertake a full rollout of eVisas to visitors from China, India, Nigeria, Kenya and 10 other countries.  "
"968",2021,"Ramaphosa","The revised list of critical skills will be published for public comment by the Department of Home Affairs, within one week, to ensure that the final version reflects the skills needed by the economy.  "
"969",2021,"Ramaphosa","The momentum that Operation Vulindlela has already built, and the support that it has received across government, shows that we are serious about reform.  "
"970",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to work relentlessly and without pause to create a more modern, efficient and competitive economy that is more open to all South Africans.  "
"971",2021,"Ramaphosa","To support our reform process, the Presidential State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Council has outlined a clear set of reforms that will enable these vital public companies to fulfil their mandate for growth and development.  "
"972",2021,"Ramaphosa","Overarching legislation for state-owned companies will be tabled in Cabinet this financial year and in Parliament in the next the financial year.   "
"973",2021,"Ramaphosa","A centralised SOE model is being implemented this financial year, which will ensure a standardised governance, financial management and operational performance framework for all SOEs.  "
"974",2021,"Ramaphosa","The mandates of all SOEs are being re-evaluated to ensure that they are responsive to the country’s needs and the implementation of the National Development Plan.  "
"975",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the midst of the economic damage caused by COVID-19, South Africa’s agricultural sector has performed remarkably well.  "
"976",2021,"Ramaphosa","In 2020, we became the world’s second-largest exporter of citrus, with strong export growth in wine, maize, nuts, deciduous fruit and sugar cane.  "
"977",2021,"Ramaphosa","The favourable weather conditions in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 mean that agriculture is likely to grow in the near term.   "
"978",2021,"Ramaphosa","This provides an opportunity for further public-private partnership in agriculture to promote transformation and ensure sustainable growth.   "
"979",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is an opportunity to accelerate land redistribution through a variety of instruments such as land restitution and expropriation of land in order to boost agricultural output.  "
"980",2021,"Ramaphosa","To date, government has redistributed over five million hectares (ha) of land, totalling around 5 500 farms, to more than 300 000 beneficiaries.  "
"981",2021,"Ramaphosa","This is in addition to the land restitution process, which has benefited over two million land claimants and resulted in the transfer of around 2,7 million ha.  "
"982",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are also pursuing programmes to assist smallholder and emerging farmers with market access, to develop skills across the entire agricultural value chain and increase the number of commercial black farmers.  "
"983",2021,"Ramaphosa","During the course of the next financial year, we will establish a land and agrarian reform agency to fast-track land reform.   "
"984",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Public Service is at the coalface of government, and lack of professionalism does not just impact service delivery; it also dents public confidence.  "
"985",2021,"Ramaphosa","Advancing honesty, ethics and integrity in the Public Service is critical if we are to build a capable state.   "
"986",2021,"Ramaphosa","Through the National School of Government, we continue to roll out courses and training programmes for government officials from entry level to senior management and the Executive.  "
"987",2021,"Ramaphosa","In October last year, I signed off on ministerial performance agreements with all Ministers, which have now been published online.   "
"988",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will enhance accountability and focused performance by members of the Executive.  "
"989",2021,"Ramaphosa","We remain on course to build a capable and professional civil service that delivers on its mandate and is accountable to the South African people.  "
"990",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are proceeding with our efforts to strengthen the local government infrastructure and accelerate service delivery through the District Development Model.  "
"991",2021,"Ramaphosa","The model brings all three spheres of government to focus on key priorities and implementation of critical high impact projects.   "
"992",2021,"Ramaphosa","Working with both public and private sector partners, government is implementing a range of measures to support municipalities to address inadequate and inconsistent service delivery in areas such water provision, infrastructure build and maintenance.  "
"993",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are focusing on the appointment of properly qualified officials at a local level to ensure effective management and provision of services.  "
"994",2021,"Ramaphosa","As we prepare for local government elections, which are due take place this year, we will need to adjust to the conditions forced upon us by COVID-19 to ensure that the people of this country can determine who represents them at this crucial level of government.  "
"995",2021,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Corruption is one of the greatest impediments to the country’s growth and development.  "
"996",2021,"Ramaphosa","The revelations from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry lay bare the extent of state capture and related corruption.   "
"997",2021,"Ramaphosa","Testimony at the commission has shown how the criminal justice system was compromised and weakened.  "
"998",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is, therefore, vital that we sustain the momentum of the rebuilding effort that we began three years ago.  "
"999",2021,"Ramaphosa","There has been great progress in turning around law enforcement bodies.  "
"1000",2021,"Ramaphosa","Critical leadership positions have been filled with capable, experienced and trustworthy professionals.  "
"1001",2021,"Ramaphosa","There is improved cooperation and sharing of resources between the respective law enforcement agencies, enabling a more integrated approach to investigations and prosecutions.  "
"1002",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have started implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which lays the basis for a comprehensive and integrated society-wide response to corruption.  "
"1003",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will shortly be appointing members of the National Anti-Corruption Advisory Council, which is a multi-sectoral body that will oversee the initial implementation of the strategy and the establishment of an independent statutory anti-corruption body that reports to Parliament.  "
"1004",2021,"Ramaphosa","When reports started to surface last year about possible fraud and corruption in the procurement of COVID-19-related goods and services, we acted decisively to put a stop to these practices, to investigate all allegations and to act against those responsible.  "
"1005",2021,"Ramaphosa","We established a fusion centre, which brings together key law enforcement agencies to share information and resources.  "
"1006",2021,"Ramaphosa","The fusion centre has brought many cases to trial and preserved or recovered millions of rands in public funds.  "
"1007",2021,"Ramaphosa","The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was authorised to investigate allegations of unlawful conduct with respect to COVID-19 procurement by all state bodies during the National State of Disaster.  "
"1008",2021,"Ramaphosa","As it reported last week, the SIU has finalised investigations into 164 contracts with a total value of R3,5 billion.   "
"1009",2021,"Ramaphosa","In a significant advance for transparency and accountability, the Political Party Funding Act, 2018 (Act 6 of 2018) will come into operation on 1 April this year.  "
"1010",2021,"Ramaphosa","This will regulate public and private funding of political parties. "
"1011",2021,"Ramaphosa","Among other things, it requires the disclosure of donations to parties and establishes two funds that will enable represented political parties to undertake their programmes.  "
"1012",2021,"Ramaphosa","Crime and violence continue to undermine people’s sense of safety and security.  "
"1013",2021,"Ramaphosa","Tackling crime is central to the success of our recovery.  "
"1014",2021,"Ramaphosa","Crimes like cable theft, railway infrastructure vandalism, land invasions, construction site disruptions and attacks on truck drivers hamper economic activity and discourage investment.  "
"1015",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have taken steps and will continue to stop these crimes and deal with those responsible in terms of the law.  "
"1016",2021,"Ramaphosa","Task teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence on sites of economic activity.   "
"1017",2021,"Ramaphosa","We are also fast-tracking the implementation and capacitation of the Border Management Agency to curb illegal immigration and cross-border crime.  "
"1018",2021,"Ramaphosa","Ending gender-based violence (GBV) is imperative if we lay claim to being a society rooted in equality and non-sexism.  "
"1019",2021,"Ramaphosa","When I launched the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in April last year, I made a promise to the women and children of this country that we were going to strengthen the Criminal Justice System to prevent them being traumatised again, and to ensure that perpetrators face justice.  "
"1020",2021,"Ramaphosa","To give effect to this, three key pieces of legislation were introduced in Parliament last year to make the criminal justice system more effective in combatting GBV.  "
"1021",2021,"Ramaphosa","To ensure that perpetrators are brought to book, we are making progress in reducing the backlog of GBV cases.  "
"1022",2021,"Ramaphosa","We continue to provide care and support to survivors of GBV.   "
"1023",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the SoNA last year, I said that we would prioritise the economic empowerment of women.   "
"1024",2021,"Ramaphosa","Last year, Cabinet approved a policy that 40% of public procurement should go to women-owned businesses and entities.  "
"1025",2021,"Ramaphosa","Several departments have started implementing this policy and are making progress.  "
"1026",2021,"Ramaphosa","Last week, we also launched a groundbreaking private sector-led GBVF Response Fund.  "
"1027",2021,"Ramaphosa","Several South African companies and global philanthropies made pledges to the value of R128 million.   "
"1028",2021,"Ramaphosa","Over the next three years, government will allocate approximately R12 billion to implement the various components of the National Strategic Plan.  "
"1029",2021,"Ramaphosa","GBV will only end when everyone takes responsibility for doing so in their homes, in their communities, in their workplaces, in their places of worship and in their schools.  "
"1030",2021,"Ramaphosa","Equally, we need to give attention to issues affecting children, including improving school-readiness, ECD planning and funding, protection against preventable diseases, policy reform around child welfare and reducing violence against children.  "
"1031",2021,"Ramaphosa","In the year ahead, we are also going to forge ahead with efforts to provide greater opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate in the economy and in society in general.  "
"1032",2021,"Ramaphosa","As we rebuild our economy in the midst of a pandemic, it is necessary that we continue – within our means – to provide support to those businesses and individuals that continue to be most affected.  "
"1033",2021,"Ramaphosa","Businesses in several sectors are still struggling and many families continue to suffer as the job market slowly recovers.  "
"1034",2021,"Ramaphosa","Over the last few months, we have had ongoing discussions with our social partners in business, labour and community-based organisations, who proposed an extension of some of the social and economic support.  "
"1035",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have, therefore, decided to extend the period for the Special COVID-19 Grant of R350 by a further three months.  "
"1036",2021,"Ramaphosa","This has proven to be an effective and efficient short-term measure to reduce the immediate impact on the livelihoods of poor South Africans.  "
"1037",2021,"Ramaphosa","We have also decided to extend the COVID-19 TERS benefit until 15 March 2021, only for those sectors that have not been able to open and operate.   "
"1038",2021,"Ramaphosa","The conditions of this extension and the sectors to be included will be announced after consultations with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council.  "
"1039",2021,"Ramaphosa","The National Treasury will work with its partners and stakeholders on improvements to the Loan Guarantee Scheme so that it better addresses the realities of SMMEs and other businesses as they strive to recover.  "
"1040",2021,"Ramaphosa","We will work with our social partners to ensure that these and other interventions provide the relief to those who most need it.  "
"1041",2021,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Just as a harsh fire gives new life to our country’s fynbos, this crisis is an opportunity to build a different, better South Africa.  "
"1042",2021,"Ramaphosa","Rebuilding our country requires a common effort.   "
"1043",2021,"Ramaphosa","It requires that all South African take responsibility and play their part.   "
"1044",2021,"Ramaphosa","Let us work together as government, as business, as labour, as political parties and as all of society to clear away the rubble and lay a new foundation.  "
"1045",2021,"Ramaphosa","Above all, let us return this country to the values upon which it was founded.  "
"1046",2021,"Ramaphosa","On the day of his release, 31 years ago, Madiba gave his first public address here in Cape Town, where he reminded South Africans that there were difficult days ahead, and that the battle was far from won.  "
"1047",2021,"Ramaphosa","Madiba said:  “Now is the time to intensify the Struggle on all fronts.”  "
"1048",2021,"Ramaphosa","“To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not be able to forgive.”  "
"1049",2021,"Ramaphosa","In counting the great cost to our society over the past year, we may be tempted to lose faith.   "
"1050",2021,"Ramaphosa","But we can get through this. "
"1051",2021,"Ramaphosa","Because we are a nation of heroes.  "
"1052",2021,"Ramaphosa","I am referring not to the glorious lineage of Struggle icons, but to the everyday heroes that walk among us, who work hard every day to put food on the table, to keep the company running, and to give support, help and care to our people.  "
"1053",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is your resilience that will help this country recover.   "
"1054",2021,"Ramaphosa","In addition to the many challenges that beset our people, we have heard that his Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini has not been well in recent days and is admitted to hospital.   "
"1055",2021,"Ramaphosa","I wish to convey my wishes for the speedy recovery of His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhekuzulu.  "
"1056",2021,"Ramaphosa","Our thoughts and prayers are with the Royal Household and the Zulu nation at this time.   "
"1057",2021,"Ramaphosa","It is our collective wish that Isilo Samabandla Wonke is soon restored to good health.  "
"1058",2021,"Ramaphosa","As we prepare for the difficult path ahead, we can draw strength From Maya Angelou’s great poem, Still I rise.  "
"1059",2021,"Ramaphosa","She writes:  Out of the huts of history’s shame I rise Up from a past that’s rooted in pain I rise I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. "
"1060",2021,"Ramaphosa","Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. "
"1061",2021,"Ramaphosa","I rise I rise I rise.  "
"1062",2021,"Ramaphosa","People of South Africa, it is your country that calls on you to rise.  "
"1063",2021,"Ramaphosa","Let us march forward together to equality, to growth, to dignity and to recovery.  "
"1064",2021,"Ramaphosa","May God bless South Africa and protect her sons and daughters.  "
"1065",2021,"Ramaphosa","I thank you."
"1066",2020,"Ramaphosa"," State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Parliament, Cape Town Speaker of the National Assembly (NA), Ms Thandi Modise, Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Mr Amos Masondo, Deputy President David Mabuza, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the judiciary, Former President Thabo Mbeki and Mrs Mbeki, Former President Kgalema Motlanthe and Mrs Motlanthe, Former Deputy President FW de Klerk and Mrs de Klerk, Former Speaker Ms Baleka Mbete and Mr Khomo, President of the Pan African Parliament, His Excellency Roger Nkodo Dang,  United Nations (UN) South Africa Representative, Ms Anne Githuku-Shongwe, Isithwalandwe, Mr Andrew Mlangeni, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Premiers and speakers of provincial legislatures, President of the South African Local Government Association and executive mayors, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), Mr Lesetja Kganyago, Heads of Chapter 9 institutions, Leaders of faith-based organisations, Leaders of academic and research institutions, Members of the diplomatic corps, Invited guests, Honourable members of the NA, Honourable members of the NCOP, Fellow South Africans,  It is 30 years since Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked out of the gates of Victor Verster Prison, a moment in our history that signalled perhaps more vividly than any other that freedom was at hand.  "
"1067",2020,"Ramaphosa","As he stood on the balcony of Cape Town City Hall to address the masses who had come in their tens of thousands to welcome him, he said:  “Our march to freedom is irreversible. "
"1068",2020,"Ramaphosa","We must not allow fear to stand in our way.”  "
"1069",2020,"Ramaphosa","Now, 30 years later, as we continue our onward march to improve the lives of our people, as we confront great challenges, as we endure troubled times, we too cannot allow fear to stand in our way.  "
"1070",2020,"Ramaphosa","We must forge ahead, permitting neither adversity nor doubt to divert us.  "
"1071",2020,"Ramaphosa","As we gather to reflect on the state of our nation, we are joined by the family of Basil February, a courageous young freedom fighter who lost his life in Zimbabwe in the Wankie Campaign of 1967.  "
"1072",2020,"Ramaphosa","For half a century, his resting place, like those of several of his comrades, has, until now, remained unknown.  "
"1073",2020,"Ramaphosa","His contribution, his sacrifice, has never been forgotten.  "
"1074",2020,"Ramaphosa","This evening, we gather here humbled by the memories of those men and women who gave their lives for our freedom, deeply aware of the great responsibility we carry to realise their dreams.  "
"1075",2020,"Ramaphosa","There are times when we have fallen short, there are times when we have made mistakes, but we remain unwavering in our determination to build a society that is free and equal and at peace.  "
"1076",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our history tells us that when we are united in peace and faith, we can conquer all obstacles and turn our country into a place in which we all feel free, safe and comfortable.  "
"1077",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is in that spirit that we now approach the present moment.  "
"1078",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our country is facing a stark reality.  "
"1079",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our economy has not grown at any meaningful rate for over a decade.  "
"1080",2020,"Ramaphosa","Even as jobs are being created, the rate of unemployment is deepening.  "
"1081",2020,"Ramaphosa","The recovery of our economy has stalled as persistent energy shortages have disrupted businesses and people’s lives.  "
"1082",2020,"Ramaphosa","Several state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are in distress, and our public finances are under severe pressure.  "
"1083",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is you, the people of South Africa, who carry this burden, confronted by rising living costs, unemployment, unable to escape poverty, unable to realise your potential.  "
"1084",2020,"Ramaphosa","Yet, at the same time, there is another part to our reality.  "
"1085",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is the reality of a youthful population that has more access to education than ever before and which is achieving steadily improving outcomes.  "
"1086",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is the reality of 2.4 million children in Early Childhood Development (ECD) and pre-school.  "
"1087",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is about the 81% of learners who passed matric last year, with an increasing proportion coming from rural and township schools.  "
"1088",2020,"Ramaphosa","For this great achievement, we applaud the Class of 2019.  "
"1089",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our reality is also that of the 720.000 students who received state funding for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges and universities last year.  "
"1090",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is about the 6.8 million South Africans who know their HIV status, about the five million people who have been initiated on antiretroviral treatment and the 4.2 million people whose HIV viral load is, as a consequence, undetectable.  "
"1091",2020,"Ramaphosa","These are not just statistics.  "
"1092",2020,"Ramaphosa","These are lives of ordinary citizens being improved.  "
"1093",2020,"Ramaphosa","They are signs of progress.  "
"1094",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our reality is also one of unbounded potential.  "
"1095",2020,"Ramaphosa","Of a soil that is rich in minerals and in a diversity of plant and animal life that has few equals in the world.  "
"1096",2020,"Ramaphosa","Of a deep capital base, extensive infrastructure, sound laws and robust institutions.  "
"1097",2020,"Ramaphosa","Of a rich, diverse, young and talented people.   "
"1098",2020,"Ramaphosa","Tonight, we are joined by Zozibini Tunzi, whose ascendance to the Miss Universe title is a reminder of our potential to achieve greatness against the odds.   "
"1099",2020,"Ramaphosa","We also welcome Springbok Captain Siya Kolisi, who led a group of determined and united South Africans to become the 2019 World Rugby Champions.  "
"1100",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are joined this evening by another remarkable young person, Ms Sinoyolo Qumba, a Grade 11 learner from Lenasia South, who spent much of yesterday helping me to write this State of the Nation Address (SoNA).  "
"1101",2020,"Ramaphosa","Her intellect, her social awareness, her passion and her diligence give me great confidence in the future of this country.  "
"1102",2020,"Ramaphosa","In my first two addresses to the nation I spoke at length about the necessity of social compacting, and the great responsibility we shoulder as government to drive collaboration and consensus.  "
"1103",2020,"Ramaphosa","In 1994, we chose the path of negotiation, compromise and peaceful settlement, instead of hatred and revenge.  "
"1104",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our history and contemporary experience has taught us that if we are to achieve what we set out to do, we must focus on what unites instead of divides.   "
"1105",2020,"Ramaphosa","The greatest strength of our constitutional democracy, and the reason it has endured, is because we have been able to forge broad-based coalitions and social compacts, be they with business, labour, special interest groups or wider civil society.  "
"1106",2020,"Ramaphosa","Achieving consensus and building social compacts is a not demonstration of weakness. "
"1107",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is the very essence of who we are.  "
"1108",2020,"Ramaphosa","That is why over the past two years we have been hard at work seeking to forge and build consensus around our economic recovery plan.   "
"1109",2020,"Ramaphosa","In his inaugural address on the 10th of May 1994, President Nelson Mandela said:  “Today we enter into a covenant that we shall build a society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity.”  "
"1110",2020,"Ramaphosa","This government remains irrevocably committed to upholding that covenant.   "
"1111",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is a covenant that is rooted in the strategic objective of our National Development Plan, which is to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030.   "
"1112",2020,"Ramaphosa","Let us frankly admit that that the government cannot solve our economic challenges alone.   "
"1113",2020,"Ramaphosa","Even if we were to marshal every single resource at our disposal, and engage on a huge expenditure of public funds, we would not alone be able to guarantee employment to the millions of people who are out of work.  "
"1114",2020,"Ramaphosa","What we have achieved, we have achieved together.  "
"1115",2020,"Ramaphosa","Over the course of the last two years – since I first stood here to deliver a SoNA – we have worked to forge compacts among South Africans to answer the many challenges before us.  "
"1116",2020,"Ramaphosa","Through the Jobs Summit, we brought labour, business, government and communities together to find solutions to the unemployment crisis, and we continue to meet at the beginning of every month, the Deputy President and myself, to remove blockages and drive interventions that will save and create jobs.  "
"1117",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have come together, as government and civil society, as communities and faith-based groupings, to confront the violence that is perpetrated by men against women.  "
"1118",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have brought business, labour and government together to craft master plans for those industries that have the greatest potential for growth.  "
"1119",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have come together as different spheres of government, as different state entities, as business associations and community groups under a new District Development Model (DDM) that is fundamentally changing our approach to local development.  "
"1120",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have been building social compacts because it is through partnership and cooperation that we progress.  "
"1121",2020,"Ramaphosa","Together, over these last two years, we have worked to stabilise our economy and build a foundation for growth.  "
"1122",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have been deliberate in rebuilding institutions and removing impediments to investment.  "
"1123",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have acted decisively against state capture and fought back against corruption.  "
"1124",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have steadily improved the reach of education, improved the quality of health care and tended to the basic needs of the poor.  "
"1125",2020,"Ramaphosa","Yet, that has not been enough.  "
"1126",2020,"Ramaphosa","It has not been enough to free our economy from the grim inheritance of our past, nor from the mistakes that we ourselves have made.  "
"1127",2020,"Ramaphosa","It has not been enough to spare us from the debilitating effects of load-shedding, nor from an unstable and subdued global economy.  "
"1128",2020,"Ramaphosa","And so we find ourselves today at a decisive moment.  "
"1129",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have a choice.  "
"1130",2020,"Ramaphosa","We can succumb to the many and difficult and protracted problems that confront us, or we can confront them, with resolve and determination and with action.  "
"1131",2020,"Ramaphosa","Because we choose to confront our challenges, our immediate, vital and overarching task is to place our economy on a path of inclusive growth.  "
"1132",2020,"Ramaphosa","Without growth there will be no jobs, and without jobs there will be no meaningful improvement in the lives of our people.  "
"1133",2020,"Ramaphosa","This SoNA is, therefore, about inclusive growth.  "
"1134",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is about the critical actions we take this year to build a capable state and place our economy on the path to recovery.  "
"1135",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year, we fix the fundamentals.  "
"1136",2020,"Ramaphosa","We pursue critical areas of growth.  "
"1137",2020,"Ramaphosa","And we ensure excellence in planning and execution in government.  "
"1138",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  For over a decade, South Africans have had to contend with the effects of a constrained energy supply.  "
"1139",2020,"Ramaphosa","I have spoken extensively about the critical role that Eskom plays in the economy of our country and in the livelihood of every South African.  "
"1140",2020,"Ramaphosa","The load-shedding of the last few months has had a debilitating effect on our country.  "
"1141",2020,"Ramaphosa","It has severely set back our efforts to rebuild the economy and to create jobs.  "
"1142",2020,"Ramaphosa","Every time it occurs, it disrupts people’s lives, causing frustration, inconvenience, hardship.  "
"1143",2020,"Ramaphosa","At its core, load-shedding is the inevitable consequence of Eskom’s inability over many years – due to debt, lack of capacity and state capture – to service its power plants.  "
"1144",2020,"Ramaphosa","The reality that we will need to accept is that in order for Eskom to undertake the fundamental maintenance necessary to improve the reliability of supply, load-shedding will remain a possibility for the immediate future.  "
"1145",2020,"Ramaphosa","Where load-shedding is unavoidable, it must be undertaken in a manner that is predictable and minimises disruption and the cost to firms and households.   "
"1146",2020,"Ramaphosa","Over the next few months, as Eskom works to restore its operational capabilities, we will be implementing measures that will fundamentally change the trajectory of energy generation in our country.  "
"1147",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are taking the following measures to rapidly and significantly increase generation capacity outside of Eskom:  A Section 34 Ministerial Determination will be issued shortly, by the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, to give effect to the Integrated Resource Plan 2019, enabling the development of additional grid capacity from renewable energy, natural gas, hydro power, battery storage and coal. "
"1148",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will initiate the procurement of emergency power from projects that can deliver electricity into the grid within three to 12 months from approval. "
"1149",2020,"Ramaphosa","The National Energy Regulator will continue to register small scale distributed generation for own use of under one megawatt (MW), for which no licence is required. "
"1150",2020,"Ramaphosa","The National Energy Regulator will ensure that all applications by commercial and industrial users to produce electricity for own use above 1MW are processed within the prescribed 120 days. "
"1151",2020,"Ramaphosa","It should be noted that there is now no limit to installed capacity above 1MW. "
"1152",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will open bid window 5 of the renewable energy Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and work with producers to accelerate the completion of window 4 projects. "
"1153",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will negotiate supplementary power purchase agreements to acquire additional capacity from existing wind and solar plants. "
"1154",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will also put in place measures to enable municipalities in good financial standing to procure their own power from IPPs. "
"1155",2020,"Ramaphosa","In line with the roadmap announced last year, Eskom has started with the process of divisionalising its three operating activities – generation, transmission and distribution – each of which will have its own board and management structures.   "
"1156",2020,"Ramaphosa","The social partners organised under the National Economic Development and Labour Council have been meeting over the last two weeks to agree on the principles of a social compact on electricity.  "
"1157",2020,"Ramaphosa","This is a historic and unprecedented development since it demonstrates the commitment of all social partners to take the necessary actions and make the necessary sacrifices to secure our energy needs.  "
"1158",2020,"Ramaphosa","Through this compact the social partners seek an efficient, productive and fit-for-purpose Eskom that generates electricity at affordable prices for communities and industries.  "
"1159",2020,"Ramaphosa","This requires both a drastic reduction in costs – including a review of irregular contracts – and measures to mobilise resources that will reduce Eskom’s debt and inject fresh capital where needed.  "
"1160",2020,"Ramaphosa","The social partners – trade unions, business, community-based organisations and government – are committed to mobilising funding to address Eskom’s financial crisis in a financially sustainable manner.  "
"1161",2020,"Ramaphosa","They would like to do this in a manner that does not put workers’ pensions at risk and that does not compromise the integrity of the financial system.  "
"1162",2020,"Ramaphosa","While they work to finalise this agreement, the reality is that our energy system will remain constrained until new energy generation comes on stream.  "
"1163",2020,"Ramaphosa","Through these immediate measures and the work underway to fundamentally restructure our electricity industry, we will achieve a secure supply of reliable, affordable and, ultimately, sustainable energy.  "
"1164",2020,"Ramaphosa","We undertake this decisive shift in our energy trajectory at a time when humankind faces its greatest existential threat in the form of climate change.  "
"1165",2020,"Ramaphosa","Yesterday, I met Ayakha Melithafa, a young climate activist from Eerste Rivier who attended the World Economic Forum in Davos this year to call on world leaders to stand firmly for climate justice.  "
"1166",2020,"Ramaphosa","Ayakha asked me to make sure no African child is left behind in the transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and sustainable society; and it is a promise I intend to keep.  "
"1167",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential Commission on Climate Change will ensure that as we move towards a low carbon growth trajectory that we leave no one behind.  "
"1168",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will finalise the Climate Change Bill, which provides a regulatory framework for the effective management of inevitable climate change impacts by enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change – and identifying new industrial opportunities in the green economy.  "
"1169",2020,"Ramaphosa","Honourable members,  We need to fix our public finances.  "
"1170",2020,"Ramaphosa","Low levels of growth mean that we are not generating enough revenue to meet our expenses, our debt is heading towards unsustainable levels, and spending is misdirected towards consumption and debt-servicing rather than infrastructure and productive activities.  "
"1171",2020,"Ramaphosa","We cannot continue along this path. "
"1172",2020,"Ramaphosa","Nor can we afford to stand still.  "
"1173",2020,"Ramaphosa","When he delivers his Budget Speech two weeks from now, the Minister of Finance will outline a series of measures to reduce spending and improve its composition.   "
"1174",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are engaged with labour and other stakeholders on measures to contain the public wage bill and reduce wastage.  "
"1175",2020,"Ramaphosa","Efforts to reduce government spending, prioritise resources more effectively, and improve the efficiency of our tax system are important – but insufficient – contributions towards stabilising our public finances.   "
"1176",2020,"Ramaphosa","Achieving sustainability will ultimately require us to address structural challenges in the economy that raise the cost of living and doing business.   "
"1177",2020,"Ramaphosa","By working with the Auditor-General to reduce irregular expenditure, by shifting government spending from consumption expenditure to investment in infrastructure, we aim to improve the state of public finances.  "
"1178",2020,"Ramaphosa","The National Treasury and the SARB are working together to ease pressure on business and consumers.   "
"1179",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have decided to establish a sovereign wealth fund as a means to preserve and grow the national endowment of our nation, giving practical meaning to the injunction that the people shall share in the country’s wealth.  "
"1180",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are also proceeding with the establishment of a state bank as part of our effort to extend access to financial services to all South Africans.  "
"1181",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Minister of Finance will provide details on these in his Budget Speech.  "
"1182",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will be undertaking far-reaching economic reform measures that we will include those contained in the paper produced by The National Treasury, entitled Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth and Competitiveness.  "
"1183",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year, we are moving from the stabilisation of SOEs to repurposing these strategic companies to support growth and development.  "
"1184",2020,"Ramaphosa","After years of state capture, corruption and mismanagement, we are working to ensure that all SOEs are able to fulfil their developmental mandate and be financially sustainable.  "
"1185",2020,"Ramaphosa","In consultation with the Presidential SOE Council, we will undertake a process of rationalisation of our SOEs and ensure that they serve strategic economic or developmental purposes.  "
"1186",2020,"Ramaphosa","The extent of the state capture, corruption and mismanagement in SOEs is best demonstrated at South Africans Airways, which was placed in business rescue late last year.  "
"1187",2020,"Ramaphosa","The business rescue practitioners are expected to unveil their plans for restructuring the airline in the next few weeks.  "
"1188",2020,"Ramaphosa","In the interests of South Africa’s aviation industry and our economy, it is essential that a future restructured airline is commercially and operationally sustainable and is not dependent on further government funding.  "
"1189",2020,"Ramaphosa","A key priority this year is to fix commuter rail, which is vital to the economy and to the quality of life of our people.   "
"1190",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our rail network daily transports over a million commuters to and from work.  "
"1191",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are modernising the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s rail network.   "
"1192",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Central Line in the Western Cape and the Mabopane Line in Pretoria have been closed for essential refurbishment and upgrades.   "
"1193",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are investing R1.4 billion in each of these lines to provide, a safe, reliable and affordable service.   "
"1194",2020,"Ramaphosa","Work underway on other lines includes station upgrades, parkway replacements, new signalling systems and overhead electrical traction upgrades.   "
"1195",2020,"Ramaphosa","As we work to fix the capabilities of the State, we know that growth and job creation will in large measure be driven by private enterprise.  "
"1196",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are therefore building an operating environment that is favourable to doing business.  "
"1197",2020,"Ramaphosa","Working together with social partners, we have continued to address several issues that have been barriers to job creation.   "
"1198",2020,"Ramaphosa","Water use licences, which are so essential to operations on farms, factories and mines, have previously taken an inordinately long time to process, sometimes up to five years.  "
"1199",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are able to announce that water use licences will now issued within 90 days.   "
"1200",2020,"Ramaphosa","It used to take months to have a company registered.   "
"1201",2020,"Ramaphosa","Through the Bizportal platform, one can now register a company in one day, register for the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the South African Revenue Service and even open a bank account.   "
"1202",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our ports are congested and inefficient.  "
"1203",2020,"Ramaphosa","During the course of this year, we will undertake a fundamental overhaul of the Durban Port – the third largest container terminal in the Southern Hemisphere – to reduce delays and costs.  "
"1204",2020,"Ramaphosa","The most significant contribution we can make to inclusive economic growth is in the development of appropriate skills and capabilities.  "
"1205",2020,"Ramaphosa","The investments we make now in ECD and early school learning will yield great economic benefits in the next two decades – and beyond.  "
"1206",2020,"Ramaphosa","But there are immediate interventions that we are making to improve the quality and the relevance of our educational outcomes.  "
"1207",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are making progress with the introduction of the three-stream curriculum model, heralding a fundamental shift in focus towards more vocational and technical education.  "
"1208",2020,"Ramaphosa","Various technical vocational specialisations have already been introduced in 550 schools and 67 schools are now piloting the occupational stream.  "
"1209",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are building nine new TVET colleges this year, in Sterkspruit, Aliwal North, Graaff Reinet and Ngungqushe in the Eastern Cape, and in Umzimkhulu, Greytown, Msinga, Nongoma and Kwagqikazi in KwaZulu-Natal.  "
"1210",2020,"Ramaphosa","Through bilateral student scholarship agreements we have signed with other countries, we are steadily building a substantial cohort of young people who go overseas each year for training in critical skills.  "
"1211",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have seen the impact this can have with the Nelson Mandela Fidel Castro Medical Training Programme in Cuba, which has produced over 1.200 medical doctors and a further 640 students are expected to graduate in December 2020.   "
"1212",2020,"Ramaphosa","This programme is a living monument to these two great revolutionaries.  "
"1213",2020,"Ramaphosa","Last year I spoke about our plan to issue tablet computers to school students.  "
"1214",2020,"Ramaphosa","The process of distributing these tablets is underway.   "
"1215",2020,"Ramaphosa","We said that every 10-year-old needs to be able to read for meaning.  "
"1216",2020,"Ramaphosa","Our early reading programmes are gathering momentum.  "
"1217",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will be introducing coding and robotics in Grades R to 3 in 200 schools, with a plan to implement it fully by 2022.  "
"1218",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have decided to establish a new University of Science and Innovation in Ekurhuleni.   "
"1219",2020,"Ramaphosa","Ekurhuleni is the only metro in our country that does not have a university.   "
"1220",2020,"Ramaphosa","This will enable young people in that metro to be trained in high-impact and cutting-edge technological innovation for current and future industries.  "
"1221",2020,"Ramaphosa","Investment and growth require a safe, stable and crime-free environment.  "
"1222",2020,"Ramaphosa","More importantly, it is fundamental to the aspirations of all our people to live in security, peace and comfort.  "
"1223",2020,"Ramaphosa","Police visibility, effective training and better resourcing of police stations are our priorities.  "
"1224",2020,"Ramaphosa","I have prioritised our response to the growing problem of criminal groups that extort money from construction and other businesses.  "
"1225",2020,"Ramaphosa","Specialised units – bringing together the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the National Prosecuting Authority – are mandated to combat these crimes of economic disruption.   "
"1226",2020,"Ramaphosa","To support the growth of the tourism industry, the SAPS will increase visibility at identified tourist attraction sites.  "
"1227",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is training Tourism Safety Monitors and will establish a reserve police capacity to focus on the policing of tourist attraction areas.  "
"1228",2020,"Ramaphosa","Anti-gang units will be further strengthened, with priority given to the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Gauteng and the Free State.  "
"1229",2020,"Ramaphosa","Following the graduation of 5.000 police trainees last year, 7.000 new police trainees have been enlisted this year to strengthen local policing.  "
"1230",2020,"Ramaphosa","To improve the quality of general and specialised SAPS investigations, we are establishing a Crime Detection University in Hammanskraal.  "
"1231",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Over the last six months, the nation has been galvanised – across communities, government, civil society, religious groupings, the judiciary and parliament – to end the crisis of violence perpetrated by men against the women of our country.   "
"1232",2020,"Ramaphosa","It has been a truly united and determined response from all South Africans.   "
"1233",2020,"Ramaphosa","Through building social compacts across society to fight this scourge, we will be able to achieve much more.  "
"1234",2020,"Ramaphosa","But it is only the beginning of the struggle.  "
"1235",2020,"Ramaphosa","We implemented an emergency action plan and reprioritised R1.6 billion to support this plan until the end of the current financial year.  "
"1236",2020,"Ramaphosa","There has been progress in several areas.  "
"1237",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will amend the Domestic Violence Act to better protect victims in violent domestic relationships and the Sexual Offences Act to broaden the categories of sex offenders whose names must be included in the National Register for Sex Offenders, and we will pass a law to tighten bail and sentencing condition in cases that involve gender-based violence (GBV).  "
"1238",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will not let up in the fight against corruption and state capture.  "
"1239",2020,"Ramaphosa","We need to work together to root out corruption and strengthen the rule of law.   "
"1240",2020,"Ramaphosa","We should not solicit or pay bribes or engage in corrupt acts.   "
"1241",2020,"Ramaphosa","We should upgrade our culture of reporting crime when we see it being committed.  "
"1242",2020,"Ramaphosa","This battle can only succeed if it is taken on by the whole of society, if we build a formidable social compact of all formations.  "
"1243",2020,"Ramaphosa","We therefore welcome the work of the joint government and civil society working group charged with developing a national anti-corruption strategy and implementation plan, which is close to completion of this phase of its work.  "
"1244",2020,"Ramaphosa","We plan to launch the strategy by mid-year.  "
"1245",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture continues with its critical work with the full support of government and other institutions.  "
"1246",2020,"Ramaphosa","I have received a detailed and voluminous report on the Commission of Inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation.   "
"1247",2020,"Ramaphosa","I will make it available to the public together with a plan on taking the findings and recommendations forward in a few days.  "
"1248",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  As we fix the fundamentals, as we deepen the reforms we have made, we pursue critical areas of inclusive growth.  "
"1249",2020,"Ramaphosa","In the previous SoNA, I said that is a critical area of investment that supports structural transformation, growth and job creation.   "
"1250",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Infrastructure Fund implementation team has finalised the list of shovel-ready projects and has begun work to expand private investment into public infrastructure sectors with revenue streams.  "
"1251",2020,"Ramaphosa","These include areas like student accommodation, social housing, independent water production, rail freight branch lines, embedded electricity generation, municipal bulk infrastructure, and broadband roll-out.   "
"1252",2020,"Ramaphosa","The team has a project pipeline with potential investments of over R700 billion over the next 10 years, including both government and non-government contributions.  "
"1253",2020,"Ramaphosa","The cranes and yellow equipment that we have longed to see across the landscape of our country will once again soon be an everyday sight.  "
"1254",2020,"Ramaphosa","The social housing programme to build rental housing for low-income families is at implementation stage, which could leverage as much as R9 billion of private investment in the construction of 37 000 rental apartments.  "
"1255",2020,"Ramaphosa","The young people who are at university and TVET colleges face serious accommodation challenges.   "
"1256",2020,"Ramaphosa","Some do not even have places to sleep after lectures and resort to sleeping in libraries.   "
"1257",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are going to spend R64 billion over the next years in student accommodation and will leverage at least another R64 billion in private investment.   "
"1258",2020,"Ramaphosa","These building projects are ready to start.  "
"1259",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have been speaking about the Umzimvubu Dam in the Eastern Cape for almost a decade, with little to show on the ground.  "
"1260",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are determined to overcome the financial and other challenges that have held back progress and denied the people of this areas such a vital resource.  "
"1261",2020,"Ramaphosa","Road construction on the site has commenced, and I will soon be visiting the site to ensure that we take this work forward.  "
"1262",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are launching a Tourism Equity Fund this year to stimulate transformation in tourism.   "
"1263",2020,"Ramaphosa","Last year, I asked the nation to join me in imagining a new smart-city, a truly post-apartheid city that would rise to change the social and economic apartheid spatial architecture.    "
"1264",2020,"Ramaphosa","A new smart-city is taking shape in Lanseria, which 350,000 to 500,000 people will call home within the next decade.  "
"1265",2020,"Ramaphosa","The process is being led by the Investment and Infrastructure Office in The Presidency alongside the provincial governments of Gauteng and North West, working together with the cities of Johannesburg, Tshwane and Madibeng.   "
"1266",2020,"Ramaphosa","Working with development finance institutions, we have put together an innovative process that will fund the bulk sewerage, electricity, water, digital infrastructure and roads that will be the foundation of the new city.   "
"1267",2020,"Ramaphosa","It will not only be smart and 5G ready, but will be a leading benchmark for green infrastructure continental and internationally.  "
"1268",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will be piloting an alternative township and rural roads programme during which four experimental road stretches of 50 km each will be constructed in various parts of the country.   "
"1269",2020,"Ramaphosa","This initiative will ensure cost effective solutions for the State, meaningful skills transfer and higher potential for labour intensive job creation than conventional roads construction methods.  "
"1270",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  We are confronted by the crisis of youth unemployment.   "
"1271",2020,"Ramaphosa","Of the 1.2 million young people who enter the labour market each year, approximately two thirds remain outside of employment, education and training.   "
"1272",2020,"Ramaphosa","More than half of all young people are unemployed. "
"1273",2020,"Ramaphosa","This is a crisis. "
"1274",2020,"Ramaphosa","We need to make this country work for young people, so that they can work for our country.  "
"1275",2020,"Ramaphosa","The solution to this crisis must be two-pronged – we must all create opportunities for youth employment and self-employment.  "
"1276",2020,"Ramaphosa","On youth employment, as from today, we begin the implementation of the Presidential Youth Employment Intervention – six priority actions over the next five years to reduce youth unemployment.  "
"1277",2020,"Ramaphosa","First, we are creating pathways for young people into the economy.   "
"1278",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are building cutting-edge solutions to reach young people where they are – online, on the phone and in person.   "
"1279",2020,"Ramaphosa","This will allow them to receive active support, information and work readiness training to increase their employability and match themselves to opportunities.   "
"1280",2020,"Ramaphosa","Starting this month, we are launching five prototype sites in five provinces that will grow to a national network reaching three million young people through multiple channels.   "
"1281",2020,"Ramaphosa","This will allow them to receive active support, information and work readiness training to increase their employability and match themselves to opportunities.  "
"1282",2020,"Ramaphosa","Secondly, we are fundamentally changing how we prepare young people for the future of work, providing shorter, more flexible courses in specific skills that employers in fast-growing sectors need.  "
"1283",2020,"Ramaphosa","Thirdly, we are developing new and innovative ways to support youth entrepreneurship and self-employment.  "
"1284",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fourthly, we are scaling up the Youth Employment Service and working with TVET colleges and the private sector to ensure that more learners receive practical experience in the workplace to complete their training.  "
"1285",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fifthly, we are establishing the first cohort of a Presidential Youth Service Programme that will unlock the agency of young people and provide opportunities for them to earn an income while contributing to nation building.  "
"1286",2020,"Ramaphosa","Finally, we will lead a youth employment initiative which will be funded by setting aside 1% of the budget to deal with the high levels of youth unemployment.   "
"1287",2020,"Ramaphosa","This will be through top slicing from the budget, which will require that we all tighten our belts and redirect resources to address the national crisis of youth unemployment.  "
"1288",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Minister of Finance will prioritise this initiative and give specific details when he delivers the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement later this year.  "
"1289",2020,"Ramaphosa","These six actions will together ensure that every young person in this country has a place to go, that their energy and capabilities are harnessed, and that they can contribute to the growth of their communities and their country.  "
"1290",2020,"Ramaphosa","As part of this intervention, the National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small Business Development will provide grant funding and business support to 1.000 young entrepreneurs in the next 100 days – starting tomorrow.   "
"1291",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have invited three of these young entrepreneurs to join us here this evening: Siyabonga Tiwana, Sibusiso Mahone and Tholakele Nkosi.   "
"1292",2020,"Ramaphosa","They and others like them prove that, given the necessary support, young people can create their own opportunities.   "
"1293",2020,"Ramaphosa","These three young entrepreneurs form part of a larger and more ambitious programme to assist 100.000 young entrepreneurs over the next three years to access business skills training, funding and market facilitation.      "
"1294",2020,"Ramaphosa","The empowerment of women is critical to inclusive economic growth.  "
"1295",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are introducing the SheTradesZA platform to assist women-owned businesses to participate in global value chains and markets.  "
"1296",2020,"Ramaphosa","Over the next five years, the Industrial Development Corporation is targeting R10 billion of own and partner funding for women-empowered businesses.  "
"1297",2020,"Ramaphosa","To create a larger market for small businesses, we plan to designate 1.000 locally produced products that must be procured from Small, Medium and Micro Entreprises.  "
"1298",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Procurement Bill will soon be presented to Parliament as part of our efforts to empower black and emerging businesses and advance radical economic transformation.   "
"1299",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year, we intensify our investment drive with the establishment of an integrated investment promotion and facilitation capability coordinated from The Presidency.  "
"1300",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will hold our third South Africa Investment Conference in November to review the implementation of previous commitments and to generate new investment into our economy.  "
"1301",2020,"Ramaphosa","At the second South Africa Investment Conference last year, over 70 companies made investment commitments of R364 billion in industries as diverse as advanced manufacturing, agro-processing, infrastructure, mining, services, tourism and hospitality.  "
"1302",2020,"Ramaphosa","In the first two years of our ambitious investment drive, we have raised a total of R664 billion in investment commitments, which is more than half of our five-year target of R1.2 trillion.  "
"1303",2020,"Ramaphosa","More importantly, these investments are having a real impact.  "
"1304",2020,"Ramaphosa","Already, projects with an investment value of R9 billion have been completed and 27 projects worth just over R250 billion are in implementation phases, with more coming on-stream this year.  "
"1305",2020,"Ramaphosa","I have visited newly-built factories that make smartphones, and plants expanded to produce more cars, and walked through the dust on construction sites at supplier parks.   "
"1306",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have been to the opening of facilities producing goods ranging from power cables to sanitary products, from tyres to food.  "
"1307",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have made important progress in finalising and implementing master plans in vital parts of our economy.   "
"1308",2020,"Ramaphosa","These master plans bring government, labour and business together to develop practical measures to spur growth at sector level and each partner contributes to making it work.  "
"1309",2020,"Ramaphosa","Thanks in large measure to the Auto Master Plan, we sold more cars to the rest of the world last year than ever before, providing jobs for young people in Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.   "
"1310",2020,"Ramaphosa","We launched a new auto special economic zone hub in Tshwane, which will expand production and local manufacture of components.   "
"1311",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Clothing and Textiles Master Plan, which was signed last year, aims to create 121.000 new jobs in the retail-clothing textile and footwear sector over the decade.  "
"1312",2020,"Ramaphosa","It involves commitments by retailers to buy goods locally, by manufacturers to invest and support transformation, and by labour to develop bargaining structures that promote agile manufacturing.   "
"1313",2020,"Ramaphosa","For its part, government has already begun to act vigorously against illegal imports, seizing almost 400 containers with under-invoiced products in the last quarter of 2019.   "
"1314",2020,"Ramaphosa","This suit that I am wearing today, like last year, was proudly made by South African workers. "
"1315",2020,"Ramaphosa","I would like to encourage all of us to buy South African products.  "
"1316",2020,"Ramaphosa","We completed the Poultry Master Plan to support chicken farmers and processors and save 54.000 jobs while creating new jobs.   "
"1317",2020,"Ramaphosa","The industry is now focused on growth, greater production and more investment.  "
"1318",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will, within two weeks, set a new poultry import tariff adjustment to support the local industry.   "
"1319",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have developed a plan with farmers and industrial users to save jobs in the sugar industry and will finalise a Sugar Master Plan within the next six weeks; and expect a new Steel Master Plan to be finalised in the coming six months.   "
"1320",2020,"Ramaphosa","Effective today, new regulations published in the Government Gazette will enable investigation and action against abuse of buyer power and price discrimination.   "
"1321",2020,"Ramaphosa","This will help even the playing field for small businesses and emerging entrepreneurs.  "
"1322",2020,"Ramaphosa","Market inquiries into data services, the grocery retail market and health care have provided the basis for measures to reduce costs to consumers and make these sectors more competitive.  "
"1323",2020,"Ramaphosa","The competition authorities are now working towards a resolution with the large mobile operators to secure deep cuts to data prices across pre-paid monthly bundles, additional discounts targeted at low income households, a free daily allocation of data and free access to educational and other public interest websites.   "
"1324",2020,"Ramaphosa","This is an important step to improve lives, bring people into the digital economy and stimulate online businesses.  "
"1325",2020,"Ramaphosa","The digital economy will increasingly become a driver of growth and a creator of employment.  "
"1326",2020,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution has made far-reaching recommendations that impact on nearly every aspect of the economy and in many areas of our lives.  "
"1327",2020,"Ramaphosa","The commission’s report provides us with the tools to ensure that we extract the greatest benefit of these revolutionary technological changes.  "
"1328",2020,"Ramaphosa","An important condition for the success of our digital economy is the availability of high demand spectrum to expand broadband access and reliability.  "
"1329",2020,"Ramaphosa","The regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, has undertaken to conclude the licensing of high demand spectrum for industry via auction before the end of 2020.   "
"1330",2020,"Ramaphosa","Because of additional requirements, the licensing of the Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN) is likely to be completed during the course of next year.  "
"1331",2020,"Ramaphosa","Agriculture is one of the industries with the greatest potential for growth.  "
"1332",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year, we implement key recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Panel on Land Reform and Agriculture to accelerate land redistribution, expand agricultural production and transform the industry.   "
"1333",2020,"Ramaphosa","Government stands ready – following the completion of the Parliamentary process to amend section 25 of the Constitution – to table an Expropriation Bill that outlines the circumstances under which expropriation of land without compensation would be permissible.  "
"1334",2020,"Ramaphosa","To date, we have released 44.000 hectares of state land for the settlement of land restitution claims, and will this year release round 700.000 hectares of state land for agricultural production.  "
"1335",2020,"Ramaphosa","We are prioritising youth, women, people with disabilities and those who have been farming on communal land and are ready to expand their operations for training and allocation of land.   "
"1336",2020,"Ramaphosa","A new beneficiary selection policy includes compulsory training for potential beneficiaries before land can be allocated to them.  "
"1337",2020,"Ramaphosa","Because of the drought in many parts of the country, farmers lost crops and livestock and many workers have lost their jobs and livelihoods.  "
"1338",2020,"Ramaphosa","Working with the Agricultural Research Council and other scientific and agricultural bodies, we have developed drought mitigation strategies that focus on developing drought resistant seeds, planting and storing fodder, removing of invasive plants and management strategies to prevent soil degradation.  "
"1339",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year we will open up and regulate the commercial use of hemp products, providing opportunities for small-scale farmers; and formulate policy on the use of cannabis products for medicinal purposes, to build this industry in line with global trends.   "
"1340",2020,"Ramaphosa","The regulatory steps will soon be announced by the relevant ministers.  "
"1341",2020,"Ramaphosa","A fundamental condition for growth and development is a healthy and productive population, with access to quality, affordable health care.  "
"1342",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have noted the enthusiastic support from South Africans during public hearings on the National Health Insurance (NHI), and are putting in place mechanisms for its implementation following conclusion of the Parliamentary process.   "
"1343",2020,"Ramaphosa","In preparation for the NHI, we have already registered more than 44 million people at over 3.000 clinics in the electronic Health Patient Registration System, and are now implementing this system in hospitals.  "
"1344",2020,"Ramaphosa","I have established the Presidential Working Group on Disability to advise my office on measures to advance the empowerment of persons with disabilities as government plans, budgets and implements its programmes.  "
"1345",2020,"Ramaphosa","Following the recognition by the Department of Basic Education in 2018 of South African Sign Language as a home language and the recommendation by the Parliamentary Constitutional Review Committee that it be the 12th official language, we are now poised to finalise the matter.  "
"1346",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Earlier this week, I returned from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, where South Africa assumed the Chairship of the African Union (AU) for 2020.  "
"1347",2020,"Ramaphosa","We take up this responsibility at an important time for our continent.  "
"1348",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) will come into effect.  "
"1349",2020,"Ramaphosa","This is our moment, as the people of the continent, to give effect to the dreams of the founding fathers of African unity.   "
"1350",2020,"Ramaphosa","South Africa will host an Extraordinary AU Summit in May this year to finalise the modalities of the Free Trade Agreement before its implementation on 1 July 2020.   "
"1351",2020,"Ramaphosa","Here we will finalise the rules that define what is a ‘Made in Africa’ product, the tariff lines that will be reduced to zero over the next five years, and the services sectors that will be opened up across the continent.   "
"1352",2020,"Ramaphosa","Allow me to take this opportunity to congratulate our compatriot, Mr Wamkele Mene, who was this past weekend elected as the first Secretary-General of the AfCFTA, and assure him of our full support as he assumes this historic and challenging responsibility.  "
"1353",2020,"Ramaphosa","South Africa has, therefore, prioritised the economic empowerment of Africa’s women during its term as AU Chair, working with all member states on measures to promote financial inclusion, preferential procurement and preferential trade arrangements for women.  "
"1354",2020,"Ramaphosa","The AU Heads of State have pledged their support for measures to end GBV on the continent, and will work towards the adoption of an AU Convention on Violence against Women during the course of this year.  "
"1355",2020,"Ramaphosa","Through the African Peer Review Mechanism, South Africa will work with other countries to advance good governance and democracy.  "
"1356",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will use all the means at our disposal – including our membership of the UN Security Council – to promote peace and security on the continent.  "
"1357",2020,"Ramaphosa","Honourable members, Fellow South Africans,  Everything we do must be underpinned by effective implementation.  "
"1358",2020,"Ramaphosa","That is why we have developed the DDM, a unique form of social compacting that involves the key role players in every district so that we can unlock development and economic opportunities.   "
"1359",2020,"Ramaphosa","It builds the capability of the State where it has been most broken.  "
"1360",2020,"Ramaphosa","During the SoNA of February 2019, I addressed the five most urgent tasks of the moment, key among which was the need to strengthen the capacity of the State to address the needs of the people.   "
"1361",2020,"Ramaphosa","A broad range of critical work is being done across government to strengthen the capacity of local government, as the sphere of government closest to the people, to achieve its developmental mandate of finding sustainable ways to meet the social, economic and material needs of communities and improve the quality of their lives.   "
"1362",2020,"Ramaphosa","Provincial and national government will re-double their efforts to support and strengthen the capacity of municipalities as required by Section 154 of the Constitution and provide for the monitoring and support of municipalities.  "
"1363",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is only when the structured support has failed that the provincial executive or national government will invoke a Section 139 intervention in strengthening local government.   "
"1364",2020,"Ramaphosa","Currently there are 40 municipalities in the country subjected to such intervention.  "
"1365",2020,"Ramaphosa","The measures that will be taken will complement the objectives of the new district-based model of development, that seeks to take an integrated approach to service delivery  Residents of the Mamusa Municipality in North West have already seen this approach in action, where the DDM was effectively utilised to clear illegal dumping sites, refurbish pump stations to stop sewage spilling in the streets, build roads and lay water pipes, and provide water and toilets to local schools.  "
"1366",2020,"Ramaphosa","This year, we plan to expand the DDM to 23 new districts, drawing on lessons from the three pilot districts – OR Tambo District Municipality, Ethekwini and Waterberg District Municipality.  "
"1367",2020,"Ramaphosa","To strengthen the capacity of the State and increase accountability, I will be signing performance agreements with all Ministers before the end of this month.  "
"1368",2020,"Ramaphosa","These agreements – which are based on the targets contained in the Medium-Term Strategic Framework – will be made public so that the people of South Africa can hold those who they elected into office to account.  "
"1369",2020,"Ramaphosa","We see these performance agreements as the cornerstone of a new culture of transparency and accountability, where those who are given the responsibility to serve – whether as elected office bearers or public servants – do what is expected of them.  "
"1370",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is a culture where corruption, nepotism and patronage are not tolerated, and action is taken against those who abuse their power or steal public money.  "
"1371",2020,"Ramaphosa","Since I took office, we have built capacity in The Presidency and elsewhere in the State to fast-track progress on a clear list of urgent reforms.   "
"1372",2020,"Ramaphosa","We have established the Project Management Office, the Infrastructure and Investment Unit and the Policy and Research Services to address obstacles to reform and improve government delivery.   "
"1373",2020,"Ramaphosa","These units are working closely with the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission, InvestSA and the Ease of Doing Business Task Team to remove impediments to investment and growth and ensure that government demonstrates visible progress quickly.   "
"1374",2020,"Ramaphosa","With an efficient and capable machinery now in place at the centre of government, we will focus on the most urgent reforms and intervene where necessary to ensure implementation.  "
"1375",2020,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  We find ourselves at a decisive moment in our history.  "
"1376",2020,"Ramaphosa","It is a time of great difficulty and doubt, but also a time laden with great opportunities.  "
"1377",2020,"Ramaphosa","Over the last two years, we have worked together to build a foundation for progress.  "
"1378",2020,"Ramaphosa","Now is the time for us to build on that foundation, to unite, to work, to persevere.  "
"1379",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will not surrender our future to doubt, despair, or division or to those who are permanently negative to the work that is being done to improve the lives of our people.   "
"1380",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will continue our onward march to improve the lives of our people.  "
"1381",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will embrace change.  "
"1382",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will cherish life.  "
"1383",2020,"Ramaphosa","We will fear nothing.  "
"1384",2020,"Ramaphosa","As we do so, we will recall the inspired lyrics of one of South Africa’s most treasured musicians, uBab’ uJoseph Shabalala, the founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whose passing we mourn this week.  "
"1385",2020,"Ramaphosa","Written in a different era, his words still ring true:  “We may face high mountains, Must cross rough seas, We must take our place in history,  And live with dignity, As we climb to reach our destiny A new age has begun.”  "
"1386",2020,"Ramaphosa","I thank you."

"
"1388",2019,"Ramaphosa","This year, as a diverse people and as a united nation, we will celebrate one of the greatest of human achievements.  "
"1389",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will celebrate the triumph of freedom over subjugation, the triumph of democracy over racial tyranny, the triumph of hope over despair.  "
"1390",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will celebrate the irresistible determination of an oppressed people to be free, equal and fulfilled.  "
"1391",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will use this time to recall the hardship and the suffering which generations of our people endured – their struggles, their sacrifices and their undying commitment to build a South Africa that belongs to all who live in it.  "
"1392",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will remember the relief and exhilaration of the day of our freedom, the moment at which we became a nation, a country at peace with itself and the world.  "
"1393",2019,"Ramaphosa","During the course of this year, we must and will reflect on the journey of the last 25 years.  "
"1394",2019,"Ramaphosa","As South Africans, we will have to ask ourselves whether we have realised the promise of our nation’s birth.  "
"1395",2019,"Ramaphosa","We must spend this year, the 25th anniversary of our freedom, asking ourselves whether we have built a society in which all South Africans equally and without exception enjoy their inalienable rights to life, dignity and liberty.  "
"1396",2019,"Ramaphosa","Have we built a society where the injustices of the past no longer define the lives of the present?  "
"1397",2019,"Ramaphosa","We must use this time to reflect on the progress we have made, the challenges we have encountered, the setbacks we have suffered, and the mistakes we have committed.  "
"1398",2019,"Ramaphosa","A year ago, we set out on a path of growth and renewal.  "
"1399",2019,"Ramaphosa","Emerging from a period of uncertainty and a loss of confidence and trust, we resolved to break with all that divides us, to embrace all that unites us.  "
"1400",2019,"Ramaphosa","We resolved to cure our country of the corrosive effects of corruption and to restore the integrity of our institutions.  "
"1401",2019,"Ramaphosa","We resolved to advance the values of our Constitution and to once again place at the centre of our national agenda the needs of the poor, unemployed, marginalised and dispossessed.  "
"1402",2019,"Ramaphosa","We agreed that, in honour of the centenary of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela and Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu, we would devote our every action, our every effort, our every utterance to the realisation of their vision of a democratic, just and equitable society.  "
"1403",2019,"Ramaphosa","In our magnificent diversity, and despite our many differences, the people of this country answered the call of Thuma Mina (Send Me).  "
"1404",2019,"Ramaphosa","In their multitudes, South Africans asked not what can be done for them, but what they could do for their country.  "
"1405",2019,"Ramaphosa","In ways both large and small, both public and private, South Africans set about building a better nation.   "
"1406",2019,"Ramaphosa","Many reached out to other South Africans to lend a hand where others were going through difficulties.   "
"1407",2019,"Ramaphosa","Others expressed a willingness to support government in its efforts to turn the country around.   "
"1408",2019,"Ramaphosa","Today, as we reflect on the year that has passed, we can attest to meaningful progress.  "
"1409",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our people have embraced the renewal that our country is going through and are much more hopeful about a better tomorrow.  "
"1410",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our people’s hope is not baseless; it is grounded on the progress that is being made.   "
"1411",2019,"Ramaphosa","Over the last year, we have begun to rebuild a durable social compact for fundamental social and economic transformation with key stakeholders as we promised.  "
"1412",2019,"Ramaphosa","As social partners, we are restoring the bonds of trust, dialogue and cooperation.  "
"1413",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are reaching out to those parts of our society that have become disaffected, disinterested or marginalised through various forms of dialogue and engagement.  "
"1414",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our efforts may have been uneven, and we still have much work to do, but we have demonstrated over the last year our shared determination to work together to confront our common challenges.  "
"1415",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have focused our efforts on reigniting growth and creating jobs.  "
"1416",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have worked together – as government, labour, business, civil society and communities – to remove the constraints to inclusive growth and to pursue far greater levels of investment.  "
"1417",2019,"Ramaphosa","We held a successful Presidential Jobs Summit that agreed on far-reaching measures that – when fully implemented – will nearly double the number of jobs being created in our economy each year.  "
"1418",2019,"Ramaphosa","Last year, a number of stakeholders raised their concerns about policy uncertainty and inconsistency.  "
"1419",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have addressed these concerns.  "
"1420",2019,"Ramaphosa","In response to the dire situation at several of our state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – where mismanagement and corruption had severely undermined their effectiveness – we have taken decisive measures to improve governance, strengthen leadership and restore stability in strategic entities.  "
"1421",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have also had to deal with the effects of state capture on vital public institutions, including our law enforcement agencies, whose integrity and ability to fulfil their mandate had been eroded in recent years.  "
"1422",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have therefore, acted to stabilise and restore the credibility of institutions like the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), the South African Revenue Service (SARS), the State Security Agency and the South African Police Service (SAPS).  "
"1423",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have appointed a new National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Advocate Shamila Batohi, to lead the revival of the NPA and to strengthen our fight against crime and corruption.  "
"1424",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are implementing the recommendations of the report of the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into SARS and are in the process of appointing a new Commissioner to head this essential institution.  "
"1425",2019,"Ramaphosa","On the basis of the report and recommendations of the High-Level Review Panel on the State Security Agency, which was chaired by former Minister Sydney Mufamadi, I will soon be announcing a number of urgent steps to enable the reconstitution of a professional national intelligence capability for South Africa.   "
"1426",2019,"Ramaphosa","Among the steps we will take to reconstitute a professional national intelligence capability will be the re-establishment of the National Security Council chaired by the President in order to ensure better coordination of the intelligence and security related functions of the State as well as the re-establishment of two arms of our intelligence service, one focusing on domestic and the other on foreign intelligence.  "
"1427",2019,"Ramaphosa","Work on the reconfiguration of the State is at an advanced stage.   "
"1428",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are pleased to note that in the spirit of active citizenry many South Africans continue to show a great interest in the future reconfigured State.   "
"1429",2019,"Ramaphosa","During the course of the past year as the Presidency, we have paid particular attention to the violence and abuse perpetrated against women and children in our society.  "
"1430",2019,"Ramaphosa","We responded to national concerns and calls by many South Africans by convening a Summit on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide that has provided a firm basis for a coordinated national response to this crisis.  "
"1431",2019,"Ramaphosa","We also convened the first Presidential Health Summit in October last year, which brought together key stakeholders from a wide range of constituencies in the health sector.   "
"1432",2019,"Ramaphosa","At this health summit, the participants dissected the crisis in the health system and proposed immediate, short term and medium-term solutions to improve the effectiveness of the health system.    "
"1433",2019,"Ramaphosa","We begin this new year encouraged by the progress we have made, working together, in reviving our economy and restoring our country’s democratic institutions.  "
"1434",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are determined to stay the course.  "
"1435",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are undaunted by the considerable difficulties we have yet to overcome.  "
"1436",2019,"Ramaphosa","All of us, as South Africans, should face up to the challenges and difficulties that lie ahead.  "
"1437",2019,"Ramaphosa","The task of building a better South Africa is our collective responsibility as a nation, as the people of South Africa.  "
"1438",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is at the centre of the work of every department of government, of every agency, of every public entity.  "
"1439",2019,"Ramaphosa","It informs every policy, every programme and every initiative.  "
"1440",2019,"Ramaphosa","While there is a broad range of critical work being done across government, this evening I want to address the five most urgent tasks at this moment in our history.  "
"1441",2019,"Ramaphosa","These are tasks that will underpin everything that we do this year.  "
"1442",2019,"Ramaphosa","Working together, we must undertake the following tasks:  -    Firstly, we must accelerate inclusive economic growth and create jobs.  -    Secondly, our history demands that we should improve the education system and develop the skills that we need now and into the future.  -    Thirdly, we are duty bound to improve the conditions of life for all South Africans, especially the poor  -    Fourthly, we have no choice but to step up the fight against corruption and state capture.  -    Fifthly, we need to strengthen the capacity of the State to address the needs of the people.  "
"1443",2019,"Ramaphosa","Over the past year, we have focused our efforts on accelerating inclusive growth, significantly increasing levels of investment and putting in place measures to create more jobs.  "
"1444",2019,"Ramaphosa","Last year, our economy was confronted by the reality of a technical recession.   "
"1445",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government responded with an economic stimulus and recovery plan that re-directed public funding to areas with the greatest potential for growth and job creation.  "
"1446",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our approach was not to spend our way out of our economic troubles, but to set the economy on a path of recovery.  "
"1447",2019,"Ramaphosa","We introduced a range of measures to ignite economic activity, restore investor confidence, support employment and address the urgent challenges that affect the lives of vulnerable members of our society.  "
"1448",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are pleased to report that significant progress has been made in restoring policy certainty on mining regulation and the visa regime, crafting the path towards mobile spectrum allocation, and reviewing port, rail and electricity prices.  "
"1449",2019,"Ramaphosa","We also began the process of stabilising and supporting 57 municipalities, where over 10,000 municipal infrastructure projects are being implemented.  "
"1450",2019,"Ramaphosa","The focus we have placed on revamping industrial parks in townships and rural areas has brought about discernible change, as industrial parks that have been lying idle are becoming productive again.  "
"1451",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have so far completed the revitalisation of 10 out of 16 identified industrial parks, in places such as Botshabelo, Phuthaditjhaba, Garankuwa, Isithebe, Komani and Seshego.  "
"1452",2019,"Ramaphosa","The levels of growth that we need to make significant gains in job creation will not be possible without massive new investment.  "
"1453",2019,"Ramaphosa","The inaugural South Africa Investment Conference in October last year provided great impetus to our drive to mobilise R1.2 trillion in investment over five years.  "
"1454",2019,"Ramaphosa","The investment conference attracted around R300 billion in investment pledges from South African and international companies.  "
"1455",2019,"Ramaphosa","There was also a significant increase in foreign direct investment last year.  "
"1456",2019,"Ramaphosa","In 2017, we recorded an inflow of foreign direct investment amounting to R17 billion.  "
"1457",2019,"Ramaphosa","Official data shows that just in the first three quarters of 2018, there was an inflow of R70 billion.  "
"1458",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is a phenomenal achievement compared to the low level of investment in the previous years.  "
"1459",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our investment envoys – Trevor Manuel, Mcebisi Jonas, Phumzile Langeni and Jacko Maree – as well as InvestSA are closely monitoring the status of the investments announced at the investment conference.  "
"1460",2019,"Ramaphosa","To prove that our investment conference was not just a talk shop where empty promises were made, as we speak, projects to the value of R187 billion are being implemented, and projects worth another R26 billion are in the pre-implementation phase.  "
"1461",2019,"Ramaphosa","Drawing on the valuable lessons we have learnt, through a more focused effort, and through the improvements we are making in the business environment, we aim to raise even more investment this year.  "
"1462",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will be identifying the sectors and firms we want and need in South Africa and actively attract investors.  "
"1463",2019,"Ramaphosa","Based on our experiences over the past year, and to build on the momentum achieved, we will host the South Africa Investment Conference again this year.   "
"1464",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is our intention that the investment we generate should be spread out in projects throughout the country.  "
"1465",2019,"Ramaphosa","In this regard, I have asked provincial governments to identify investable projects and ensure that we build investment books for each of our nine provinces to present to potential investors.  "
"1466",2019,"Ramaphosa","Following our successful investment conference, a group of South African business leaders moved by the spirit of Thuma Mina initiated the Public-Private Growth Initiative to facilitate focused investment plans of leading companies across 19 sectors of the economy; from mining to renewable energy; from manufacturing to agriculture.  "
"1467",2019,"Ramaphosa","These industries expect to substantially expand investment over the next five years and create a vast number of new jobs, especially if we can enhance demand for local goods, further stabilise the labour environment and improve conditions for doing business.  "
"1468",2019,"Ramaphosa","As part of our ongoing work to remove constraints to greater investment, we have established a team from the Presidency, InvestSA, National Treasury and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation that will address the policy, legal, regulatory and administrative barriers that frustrate investors.  "
"1469",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is an important aspect of our work to improve the ease of doing business in South Africa, which is essential to attracting investment.  "
"1470",2019,"Ramaphosa","This team will report progress to Cabinet on a monthly basis.  "
"1471",2019,"Ramaphosa","The World Bank’s annual Doing Business Report currently ranks South Africa 82 out of 190 countries tracked.   "
"1472",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have set ourselves the target of being among the top 50 global performers within the next three years.  "
"1473",2019,"Ramaphosa","It has long been recognised that one of the constraints that inhibit the growth of our economy is the high level of economic concentration.  "
"1474",2019,"Ramaphosa","The structure of our economy was designed to keep assets in a few hands.  "
"1475",2019,"Ramaphosa","This has stifled growth and enterprise and has, to a large extent, kept many young South African entrepreneurs and small enterprises out of the economy or confine them to the margins.  "
"1476",2019,"Ramaphosa","As part of our efforts to increase investment, and to foster greater inclusion and create more opportunities, I will soon sign into law the Competition Amendment Bill.  "
"1477",2019,"Ramaphosa","This will give the competition authorities the ability to address this problem but more importantly it will open up new opportunities for many South Africans to enter various sectors of the economy and compete on an equal footing.  "
"1478",2019,"Ramaphosa","To stimulate growth in the economy, to build more businesses and employ more people, we need to find new and larger markets for our goods and services.  "
"1479",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will therefore be focusing greater attention on expanding exports.  "
"1480",2019,"Ramaphosa","In line with the jobs summit commitments, we will focus on the export of manufactured goods and trade in services such as business process outsourcing and the remote delivery of medical services.  "
"1481",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will also be looking at establishing special economic zones that are dedicated to producing specific types of products, such as clothing and textiles, for example.  "
"1482",2019,"Ramaphosa","To improve the competitiveness of our exports, we will complete the studies that have begun on reducing the costs of electricity, trade, communications, transport and other costs.  "
"1483",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will focus on raising the sophistication of our exports.  "
"1484",2019,"Ramaphosa","The agreement on the establishment of African Continental Free Trade Area offers great opportunities to place South Africa on a path of investment-led trade, and to work with other African countries to develop their own industrial capacity.   "
"1485",2019,"Ramaphosa","The agreement will see the creation of a market of over a billion people with a combined gross domestic product of approximately $3.3 trillion.  "
"1486",2019,"Ramaphosa","Alongside a focus on exports, we will pursue measures to increase local demand through, among other things, increasing the proportion of local goods and services procured both by government and the private sector.  "
"1487",2019,"Ramaphosa","Increasing local demand, and reducing the consumption of imports, is important because it increases the opportunities for producers within South Africa to serve a growing market.  "
"1488",2019,"Ramaphosa","Through this, we will intensify the “buy South Africa” programme.  "
"1489",2019,"Ramaphosa","Given the key role that small businesses play in stimulating economic activity and employment – and in advancing broad-based empowerment – we are focusing this year on significantly expanding our Small Business Incubation Programme.  "
"1490",2019,"Ramaphosa","The incubation programme provides budding entrepreneurs with physical space, infrastructure and shared services, access to specialised knowledge, market linkages, training in the use of new technologies and access to finance.  "
"1491",2019,"Ramaphosa","The incubation programme currently consists of a network of 51 technology business incubators, 10 enterprise supplier development incubators and 14 rapid youth incubators.   "
"1492",2019,"Ramaphosa","As part of the expansion of this programme, township digital hubs will be established, initially in four provinces, with more to follow.  "
"1493",2019,"Ramaphosa","We expect these hubs to provide most needed entrepreneurial service to small and medium enterprises in the rural areas and townships but more especially to young people who want to start their businesses.  "
"1494",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our greatest challenge is to create jobs for the unemployed of today, while preparing workers for the jobs of tomorrow.  "
"1495",2019,"Ramaphosa","The Presidential Jobs Summit last year resulted in concrete agreements between organised labour, business, community and government.   "
"1496",2019,"Ramaphosa","These agreements, which are now being implemented by social partners, aim to create 275,000 additional direct jobs every year.  "
"1497",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have come up with great plans, platforms and initiatives through which we continue to draw young people in far greater numbers into productive economic activity through initiatives like the Employment Tax Incentive.  "
"1498",2019,"Ramaphosa","This incentive will be extended for another 10 years.  "
"1499",2019,"Ramaphosa","In addition, we have launched the Youth Employment Service, which is placing unemployed youth in paid internships in companies across the economy.   "
"1500",2019,"Ramaphosa","We call on all companies, both big and small, to participate in this initiative and thereby contribute not only to building their business but also to building the economy and fostering social cohesion.  "
"1501",2019,"Ramaphosa","Progress is being made in the areas of installation, repair and maintenance jobs, digital and tech jobs like coding and data analytics, as well as global business services.  "
"1502",2019,"Ramaphosa","These enable us to absorb more youth – especially those exiting schools and colleges, and those not in any education, training or employment – into productive economic activity and further work opportunities.  "
"1503",2019,"Ramaphosa","As government, we have decided that the requirement for work experience at entry-level in state institutions will be done away with.   "
"1504",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our young people need to be given a real head start in the world of work.   "
"1505",2019,"Ramaphosa","They should not face barriers and hindrances as they seek to find work.  "
"1506",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are focusing our attention, our policies and our programmes on the key parts of the economy that are labour intensive.  "
"1507",2019,"Ramaphosa","These include agriculture, tourism and the Oceans Economy.  "
"1508",2019,"Ramaphosa","The potential of agriculture in South Africa for job creation and economic growth still remains largely underdeveloped.  "
"1509",2019,"Ramaphosa","South Africa still has large areas of under utilised or unproductive land.   "
"1510",2019,"Ramaphosa","There are around 250,000 small emerging farmers who are working the land and need support in fully developing their businesses.  "
"1511",2019,"Ramaphosa","Agricultural exports are an important source of revenue for our economy, and developing our agricultural sector is key to enhancing our food security and for attracting investment.   "
"1512",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are fortunate to have an agricultural sector that is well-developed, resilient and diversified.   "
"1513",2019,"Ramaphosa","We intend to use it as a solid foundation to help develop agriculture in our country for the benefit of all.  "
"1514",2019,"Ramaphosa","Through an accelerated programme of land reform, we will work to expand our agricultural output and promote economic inclusion.  "
"1515",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our policy and legislative interventions will ensure that more land is made available for agriculture, industrial development and human settlements.  "
"1516",2019,"Ramaphosa","I wish to commend the many South Africans who participated in the work of the Constitutional Review Committee in the dialogue that ensued through the length and the breadth of the country.   "
"1517",2019,"Ramaphosa","I applaud the members of the Constitutional Review Committee for remaining focused throughout this period and sifting through the submissions that were made by ordinary South Africans and their organisations.   "
"1518",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will support the work of the Constitutional Review Committee tasked with the review of Section 25 of the Constitution to unambiguously set out provisions for expropriation of land without compensation.   "
"1519",2019,"Ramaphosa","Alongside this constitutional review process, we tasked the Deputy President to lead the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Land Reform to fast-track land reform.  "
"1520",2019,"Ramaphosa","An advisory panel of experts headed by Dr Vuyo Mahlathi, established to advise government on its land reform programme, is expected to table its report by the end of March 2019.  "
"1521",2019,"Ramaphosa","As part of accelerating land reform, we have identified land parcels owned by the State for redistribution.  "
"1522",2019,"Ramaphosa","Strategically located land will be released to address human settlements needs in urban and peri-urban areas.   "
"1523",2019,"Ramaphosa","As part of the stimulus package in agriculture, we have invested significantly in comprehensive farmer development support to ensure that restituted and communal land is productively utilised.  "
"1524",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to prioritise targeted skills development and capacity building programmes for smallholder and emerging black farmers.   "
"1525",2019,"Ramaphosa","In the coming year, we will continue to focus on high value agricultural products with export potential such as our fruit, wine and vegetable industries, as well as poultry and red meat.  "
"1526",2019,"Ramaphosa","During SoNA last year, we spoke at length about the huge potential that exists for the expansion of the tourism sector.  "
"1527",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our concerted efforts to market South Africa as a prime destination for tourists has yielded positive results, with significant annual growth in the number of foreign visitors.  "
"1528",2019,"Ramaphosa","In the past year, we had 10 million tourists who came to our country.   "
"1529",2019,"Ramaphosa","We intend to raise this to 21 million by 2030, targeting, among others, the largest and fastest growing markets of India and China, as well as strong markets on our continent.  "
"1530",2019,"Ramaphosa","In addition to direct jobs, this export industry could generate as many as two million more jobs in food and agriculture, construction, transport, retail, and the creative and cultural industries by 2030.   "
"1531",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will deepen the partnership between government and business to realise this vision.  "
"1532",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our highest priority this year will be on the introduction of a world class eVisa regime.   "
"1533",2019,"Ramaphosa","This, combined with enhanced destination marketing and measures to strengthen tourism safety, will create the conditions for the growth we envisage, and the jobs and opportunities that will follow.  "
"1534",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our beautiful country, South Africa, has one of the world’s longest coastlines spanning 3,000km around the contours of our country from the east to the west.   "
"1535",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our mere positioning as a country means we can harness the potential of our oceans to grow the economy.  "
"1536",2019,"Ramaphosa","Since  Operation Phakisa on the Oceans Economy in 2014, we have secured investments of nearly R30 billion and created over 7,000 direct jobs.  "
"1537",2019,"Ramaphosa","The investments have been mainly in infrastructure development, marine manufacturing, aquaculture, and the oil and gas sector.  "
"1538",2019,"Ramaphosa","Expected investment in the Oceans Economy over the next five years is estimated at R3,8 billion by government and R65 billion by the private sector.  "
"1539",2019,"Ramaphosa","These investments are expected to create over 100,000 direct jobs and more than 250,000 indirect jobs.  "
"1540",2019,"Ramaphosa","Last night, I received a call from Minister Gwede Mantashe when he told me that the oil giant Total would be making a big announcement today about a new “world-class” oil and gas discovery off the coast of South Africa.   "
"1541",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are extremely encouraged by the report this morning about the Brulpadda block in the Outeniqua Basin, which some have described as a catalytic find.  "
"1542",2019,"Ramaphosa","This could well be a game-changer for our country and will have significant consequences for our country’s energy security and the development of this industry.  "
"1543",2019,"Ramaphosa","We congratulate Total and its various partners and wish them well in their endeavours.   "
"1544",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government will continue to develop legislation for the sector so that it is properly regulated for the interests of all concerned.  "
"1545",2019,"Ramaphosa","Over the past five years, we made significant progress with the provision of infrastructure.   "
"1546",2019,"Ramaphosa","More than R1,3 trillion has been invested to build hundreds of schools and two new universities, to build hundreds of thousands of new houses, to electrify more than a million homes, generate new electricity and to expand public transport.   "
"1547",2019,"Ramaphosa","These infrastructure investments also helped grow our economy and create many new jobs in construction and other sectors.   "
"1548",2019,"Ramaphosa","Infrastructure development has been flywheel of the engine of our economy and has yielded tremendous benefits for the country.   "
"1549",2019,"Ramaphosa","We must do more.   "
"1550",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our infrastructure development has slowed down for a whole number of reasons.   "
"1551",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have also realised that our infrastructure provision is too fragmented between the different spheres of government.   "
"1552",2019,"Ramaphosa","It does not fully integrate new housing development with economic opportunities and with the building of dams, water pipelines, schools and other amenities.   "
"1553",2019,"Ramaphosa","Cabinet has adopted a new infrastructure implementation model to address these problems.  "
"1554",2019,"Ramaphosa","It will be underpinned by the new Infrastructure Fund announced in September last year.  "
"1555",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government has committed to contribute R100 billion into the Infrastructure Fund over a 10-year period and use this to leverage financing from the private sector and development finance institutions.   "
"1556",2019,"Ramaphosa","As a first step, we will expand projects underway already, such as student accommodation.   "
"1557",2019,"Ramaphosa","We plan to do things differently, starting with a deeper partnership with our communities in the planning, building and maintenance of infrastructure.  "
"1558",2019,"Ramaphosa","Just as we did with the Vaal River, where the South African National Defence Force intervened to address a sewage crisis, we will call on all the capabilities of the State and the private sector to address infrastructure challenges.   "
"1559",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will strengthen the technical capacity in government to ensure that projects move faster, building a pool of engineers, project managers, spatial planners and quantity surveyors – an action team that can make things happen faster on the ground.  "
"1560",2019,"Ramaphosa","The telecommunications sector represents vast potential for boosting economic growth.  "
"1561",2019,"Ramaphosa","The Minister of Communications will shortly be issuing policy direction to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa for the licensing of the high demand radio frequency spectrum.   "
"1562",2019,"Ramaphosa","As a water scarce country, we are confronting water crises in many parts of the country.  "
"1563",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are developing a comprehensive integrated nation plan that addresses water shortages, ageing infrastructure and poor project implementation.  "
"1564",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are urgently establishing an inter-governmental rapid response technical team, reinforced by specialist professionals, to intervene in areas which are experiencing severe water problems.  "
"1565",2019,"Ramaphosa","In one of these areas, Giyani, extensive work is underway to get water to the residents, in the immediate term through the repair of boreholes, and then through the rapid provision of proper infrastructure.  "
"1566",2019,"Ramaphosa","The safety of our learners in school is critical for creating a healthy learning environment.  "
"1567",2019,"Ramaphosa","We recall with deep sadness the tragic deaths of Michael Komape, who drowned in a pit toilet at Mahlodumela Primary School in Limpopo in 2014, and Lumka Mkethwa, from Luna Junior Primary School in the Eastern Cape, who lost her life in March last year.  "
"1568",2019,"Ramaphosa","We conducted an audit last year and found that nearly 4,000 schools still have inappropriate sanitation facilities.  "
"1569",2019,"Ramaphosa","Given the scale and urgency of the problem, we launched the SAFE Initiative in August last year, through which we mobilised all available resources, including pledges from business, strategic partners, and the building industry to replace all unsafe toilets in public schools.  "
"1570",2019,"Ramaphosa","Since we launched the initiative, 699 schools have been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities and projects in a further 1,150 schools are either in planning, design or construction stages.  "
"1571",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are determined to eradicate unsafe and inappropriate sanitation facilities within the next three years.   "
"1572",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is an outstanding example of collaboration between government and business to address with urgency a great need that impacts on the right of South Africa’s children to safety and dignity in educational facilities.  "
"1573",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are making important progress in restoring the integrity and capacity of our strategic SOEs.  "
"1574",2019,"Ramaphosa","To restore proper corporate governance, new boards with credible, appropriately experienced and ethical directors, have been appointed at Eskom, Denel, Transnet, SAFCOL, PRASA and SA Express.  "
"1575",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have established the Presidential SOE Council, which will provide political oversight and strategic management in order to reform, reposition and revitalise SOEs, so they play their role as catalysts of economic growth and development.  "
"1576",2019,"Ramaphosa","We want our SOEs to be fully self-sufficient and be able to fulfil their development and economic role.  "
"1577",2019,"Ramaphosa","Where SOEs are not able to raise sufficient financing from banks, from capital markets, from development finance institutions or from the fiscus, we will need to explore other mechanisms, such as strategic equity partnerships or selling off non-strategic assets.   "
"1578",2019,"Ramaphosa","As we do all this, we will not support any measures that, in any form, dispose of assets of the State that are strategic to the wellbeing of the economy and the people.  "
"1579",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have the task and the responsibility to safeguard, build and sustain these key institutions for future generations.  "
"1580",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have sought credible plans from boards to put in place the right skills and expertise to manage these companies so that we can shift the focus from immediate stability to long-term sustainability.  "
"1581",2019,"Ramaphosa","We also seek to build a pragmatic and cooperative relationship between government, organised labour and private sector stakeholders, where we can jointly determine a strategic path for SOEs to create jobs, enable inclusive growth and become operationally and financially sustainable.  "
"1582",2019,"Ramaphosa","Security of energy supply is an absolute imperative.  "
"1583",2019,"Ramaphosa","Eskom is in crisis and the risks it poses to South Africa are great.  "
"1584",2019,"Ramaphosa","It could severely damage our economic and social development ambitions.  "
"1585",2019,"Ramaphosa","We need to take bold decisions and decisive action.   "
"1586",2019,"Ramaphosa","The consequences may be painful, but they will be even more devastating if we delay.  "
"1587",2019,"Ramaphosa","In responding to this crisis, we are informed by the need to minimise any adverse economic cost to the consumer and taxpayer.  "
"1588",2019,"Ramaphosa","As we address the challenges that face Eskom we will ensure that there is meaningful consultation and dialogue with all key stakeholders.   "
"1589",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will lead a process with labour, Eskom and other stakeholders to work out the details of a just transition, and proper, credible and sustainable plans that will address the needs of all those who may be affected.  "
"1590",2019,"Ramaphosa","As we address the challenges that face Eskom, we also need to safeguard our national fiscal framework, achieve a positive impact on our sovereign credit rating, and pay attention to the rights and obligations of Eskom’s funders.  "
"1591",2019,"Ramaphosa","Eskom has come up with a nine-point turnaround plan which we support and want to see implemented.   "
"1592",2019,"Ramaphosa","In line with this plan, Eskom will need to take urgent steps to significantly reduce its costs.   "
"1593",2019,"Ramaphosa","It will need more revenue through an affordable tariff increase.   "
"1594",2019,"Ramaphosa","We need to take steps to reduce municipal non-payment and confront the culture of non-payment that exists in some communities.  "
"1595",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is imperative that all those who use electricity – over and above the free basic electricity provided – should pay for it.  "
"1596",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government will support Eskom’s balance sheet, and the Minister of Finance will provide further details on this in the Budget Speech.  "
"1597",2019,"Ramaphosa","This we will do without burdening the fiscus with unmanageable debt.  "
"1598",2019,"Ramaphosa","To ensure the credibility of the turnaround plan and avoid a similar financial crisis in a few years’ time, Eskom will need to develop a new business model.  "
"1599",2019,"Ramaphosa","This business model needs to take into account the root causes of its current crisis and the profound international and local changes in the relative costs, and market penetration of energy resources, especially clean technologies.  "
"1600",2019,"Ramaphosa","It needs to take into account the role that Eskom itself should play in clean generation technologies.  "
"1601",2019,"Ramaphosa","To bring credibility to the turnaround and to position South Africa’s power sector for the future, we shall immediately embark on a process of establishing three separate entities – Generation, Transmission and Distribution – under Eskom Holdings.  "
"1602",2019,"Ramaphosa","This will ensure that we isolate cost and give responsibility to each appropriate entity.   "
"1603",2019,"Ramaphosa","This will also enable Eskom to be able to raise funding for its various operations much easily from funders and the market.  "
"1604",2019,"Ramaphosa","Of particular and immediate importance is the entity to manage an independent state-owned transmission grid combined with the systems operator and power planning, procurement and buying functions.  "
"1605",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is imperative that we undertake these measures without delay to stabilise Eskom’s finances, ensure security of electricity supply, and establish the basis for long-term sustainability.  "
"1606",2019,"Ramaphosa","At the centre of all our efforts to achieve higher and more equitable growth, to draw young people into employment and to prepare our country for the digital age, must be the prioritisation of education and the development of skills.  "
"1607",2019,"Ramaphosa","With over 700,000 children accessing early childhood education in the last financial year, we have established a firm foundation for a comprehensive Early Childhood Development (ECD) Programme that is an integral part of the education system.  "
"1608",2019,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will migrate responsibility for ECD centres from Social Development to Basic Education, and proceed with the process towards two years of compulsory ECD for all children before they enter Grade 1.  "
"1609",2019,"Ramaphosa","Another critical priority is to substantially improve reading comprehension in the first years of school.  "
"1610",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is essential in equipping children to succeed in education, in work and in life – and it is possibly the single most important factor in overcoming poverty, unemployment and inequality.  "
"1611",2019,"Ramaphosa","The department’s early grade reading studies have demonstrated the impact that a dedicated package of reading resources, expert reading coaches and lesson plans can have on reading outcomes.  "
"1612",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will be substantially expanding the availability of these early reading resources across the foundation phase of schooling.  "
"1613",2019,"Ramaphosa","Over the next six years, we will provide every school child in South Africa with digital workbooks and textbooks on a tablet device.  "
"1614",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will start with those schools that have been historically most disadvantaged and are located in the poorest communities, including multigrade, multiphase, farm and rural schools.  "
"1615",2019,"Ramaphosa","Already, 90% of textbooks in high enrolment subjects across all grades and all workbooks have been digitised.   "
"1616",2019,"Ramaphosa","In line with our Framework for Skills for a Changing World, we are expanding the training of both educators and learners to respond to emerging technologies, including the internet of things, robotics and artificial intelligence.  "
"1617",2019,"Ramaphosa","Several new technology subjects and specialisations will be introduced, including technical mathematics and technical sciences, maritime sciences, aviation studies, mining sciences, and aquaponics.  "
"1618",2019,"Ramaphosa","To expand participation in the technical streams, several ordinary public schools will be transformed into technical high schools.  "
"1619",2019,"Ramaphosa","In line with government’s commitment to the right of access to higher education for the poor, last year we introduced free higher education for qualifying first year students.   "
"1620",2019,"Ramaphosa","Thanks to this initiative, links have been re-established with all institutions, and institution heads and student leaders have played a critical role in communicating with students.  "
"1621",2019,"Ramaphosa","The scheme is being phased in over a five-year period until all undergraduate students who qualify in terms of the criteria can benefit.  "
"1622",2019,"Ramaphosa","Stabilising the business processes of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme will also be a priority in the coming year so that it is properly capacitated to carry out its critical role in supporting eligible students.  "
"1623",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are concerned about developments on some campuses this week, especially reports of violence and intimidation.  "
"1624",2019,"Ramaphosa","Of particular concern, is the tragic death of Mlungisi Madonsela, a student at the Durban University of Technology.  "
"1625",2019,"Ramaphosa","We extend our deepest condolences to his family and call on law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate the incident.  "
"1626",2019,"Ramaphosa","We call on student representatives and university authorities to work together to find solutions to the challenges that students are facing.  "
"1627",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will give effect to our commitment to build human settlements in well-located areas that bring together economic opportunities and all the services and amenities that people need.  "
"1628",2019,"Ramaphosa","The Housing Development Agency will construct an additional 500,000 housing units in the next five years, and an amount of R30 billion will be provided to municipalities and provinces to enable them to fulfil their respective mandates.  "
"1629",2019,"Ramaphosa","However, if we are to effectively address the substantial housing backlog in our country, we need to develop different models of financing for human settlements.  "
"1630",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is for this reason that we are establishing a Human Settlements Development Bank that will leverage both public and private sector financing to aid in housing delivery.  "
"1631",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will also be expanding the People’s Housing Programme, where households are allocated serviced stands to build their own houses, either individually or through community-led housing cooperatives.   "
"1632",2019,"Ramaphosa","South Africa has one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching social security nets in the world, providing a buffer between poor households and abject poverty.   "
"1633",2019,"Ramaphosa","Every month 17,5 million social grants are provided to South Africans.   "
"1634",2019,"Ramaphosa","The Department of Social Development is to be commended for having honoured the Constitutional Court’s directive for phasing out the services of Cash Paymaster Services.   "
"1635",2019,"Ramaphosa","To date the majority of grant beneficiaries have been successfully migrated to the South African Post Office, and the old South African Social Security Agency cards replaced by new ones.  "
"1636",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have made significant progress in devising a comprehensive Social Security Strategy through the National Economic Development and Labour Council.   "
"1637",2019,"Ramaphosa","The reforms focus on achieving comprehensive social security and retirement reform that is affordable, sustainable and appropriate for all South Africans.   "
"1638",2019,"Ramaphosa","With the assistance of the National Planning Commission, we reached consensus on reforms that include the National Social Security Fund, institutional arrangements, regulatory reforms, improved unemployment benefits, improved social assistance coverage, and active labour market policies for citizens between 18 and 59 years.   "
"1639",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will now incorporate this consensus agreement into a policy framework to guide implementation.  "
"1640",2019,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will take a significant step towards universal access to quality health care for all South Africans.  "
"1641",2019,"Ramaphosa","After extensive consultation, the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill will soon be ready for submission to Parliament.  "
"1642",2019,"Ramaphosa","The NHI will enable South Africans to receive free services at the point of care in public and private quality accredited health facilities.  "
"1643",2019,"Ramaphosa","By applying the principle of social solidarity and cross-subsidisation, we aim to reduce inequality in access to health care.   "
"1644",2019,"Ramaphosa","Realising the magnitude of the challenges in health care, we have established an NHI and quality improvement War Room in the Presidency, consisting of various key departments to address the crisis in the public health system while preparing for the implementation of the NHI.   "
"1645",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have a funded national quality health improvement plan to improve every clinic and hospital that will be contracted by the NHI.   "
"1646",2019,"Ramaphosa","By introducing the NHI together with a multi-pronged quality improvement programme for public health facilities, we are working towards a massive change in the health care experience of South Africans.  "
"1647",2019,"Ramaphosa","While we have made progress since 1994 in bringing down certain categories of serious crime, communities across the country are still plagued by gangsterism and violence.  "
"1648",2019,"Ramaphosa","As part of our concerted effort to make our country safer and more secure, the Community Policing Strategy was launched in October last year.   "
"1649",2019,"Ramaphosa","The strategy focuses on building partnerships between communities and the police; making more resources available for policing and better communication between the police and communities about crime prevention strategies.   "
"1650",2019,"Ramaphosa","This will enable policemen and women to become more proactive in addressing crime and broader public safety concerns.   "
"1651",2019,"Ramaphosa","In addition, we are strengthening the functioning of various specialised units such as the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences units and improving our administrative and record keeping capacity at all levels.    "
"1652",2019,"Ramaphosa","The SAPS has embarked on a restructuring process to shift more policing resources to the local level.  "
"1653",2019,"Ramaphosa","Violence against women and children has reached epidemic proportions.  "
"1654",2019,"Ramaphosa","Every day, South African women are faced with discrimination, abuse, violence and even death, often by those they are closest to.  "
"1655",2019,"Ramaphosa","Over the last year, we have started to address this scourge in a more serious and coordinated way.  "
"1656",2019,"Ramaphosa","At the Presidential Gender-based Violence and Femicide Summit, women from all walks of life came together with government and civil society to outline a road map to end gender-based violence, improve coordination of planning, and establish a commitment to resourcing and accountability.    "
"1657",2019,"Ramaphosa","Work is underway to implement the decisions of the summit, including preparing the National Strategic Plan on Gender- Based Violence.  "
"1658",2019,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will work with our partners in civil society to implement the decisions of the National Summit on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide.  "
"1659",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are expanding and dedicating more funds to places of support, such as the Thuthuzela Care Centres and Khuseleka Care Centres.   "
"1660",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have been working to ensure the better functioning of sexual offences courts.  "
"1661",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will improve the quality of services in shelters and ensure they also accommodate members of the LGBTQI+ community.  "
"1662",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will strengthen the national hotline centre that supports women who experience gender-based violence and ensure it is functional.  "
"1663",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have listened to the call to make funds available to combat gender-based violence, and have allocated funding in the current budget to support the decisions taken at the summit.  "
"1664",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government will lead the campaign to include men and boys as active champions in the struggle against gender-based violence.  "
"1665",2019,"Ramaphosa","Ending gender-based violence is an urgent national priority that requires the mobilisation of all South Africans and the involvement of all institutions.  "
"1666",2019,"Ramaphosa","South Africa has extremely high levels of substance abuse, which feeds crime and violence against women and children, it deepens poverty and causes great hardship and pain for families.  "
"1667",2019,"Ramaphosa","As government we continue to roll-out interventions to address social ills tearing our communities apart such as alcoholism and substance abuse.  "
"1668",2019,"Ramaphosa","Knowing as we do that there are strong linkages between substance abuse, drug trafficking, crime and insecurity in communities – we are focusing on tackling this problem at its source through prevention programmes targeting vulnerable persons especially our youth.   "
"1669",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are resolute that all taverns, shebeens and liquour outlets near school premises must be shut down.  "
"1670",2019,"Ramaphosa","We recognise, as do all South Africans, that our greatest efforts to end poverty, unemployment and inequality will achieve little unless we tackle state capture and corruption in all its manifestations and in all areas of public life.  "
"1671",2019,"Ramaphosa","The action we take now to end corruption and hold those responsible to account will determine the pace and trajectory of the radical social and economic transformation we seek.  "
"1672",2019,"Ramaphosa","The revelations emerging from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture and other commissions are deeply disturbing, for they reveal a breadth and depth of criminal wrongdoing that challenges the very foundation of our democratic State.  "
"1673",2019,"Ramaphosa","We commend these commissions for the work they are doing, often under challenging circumstances, to uncover the truth.  "
"1674",2019,"Ramaphosa","These commissions need to be able to do their work without any hindrance, and we call on all those people who are in a position to assist them in their investigations to make themselves available.  "
"1675",2019,"Ramaphosa","While these commissions will in time make findings and recommendations in line with their mandates, evidence of criminal activity that emerges must be evaluated by the criminal justice system.  "
"1676",2019,"Ramaphosa","Where there is a basis to prosecute, prosecutions must follow swiftly and stolen public funds must be recovered urgently.  "
"1677",2019,"Ramaphosa","To this end, we have agreed with the new NDPP, that there is an urgent need to establish in the office of the NDPP an investigating directorate dealing with serious corruption and associated offences, in accordance with section 7 of the NPA Act.  "
"1678",2019,"Ramaphosa","I will soon be promulgating a proclamation that will set out the specific terms of reference of the directorate.  "
"1679",2019,"Ramaphosa","In broad terms, the directorate will focus on the evidence that has emerged from the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, other commissions and disciplinary inquiries.   "
"1680",2019,"Ramaphosa","It will identify priority cases to investigate and prosecute and will recover assets identified to be the proceeds of corruption.  "
"1681",2019,"Ramaphosa","The Directorate will bring together a range of investigatory and prosecutorial capacity from within government and in the private sector under an investigating director reporting to the NDPP.   "
"1682",2019,"Ramaphosa","In the longer term, we will work with the NPA and other agencies of law enforcement to develop a more enduring solution that will strengthen the capacity of the criminal justice system to deal with corruption.   "
"1683",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  As we grapple with the challenges of our recent past, and as we deepen our efforts to overcome the grave injustices of centuries, it is essential that we do so with our eyes firmly fixed on the future.  "
"1684",2019,"Ramaphosa","The world we now inhabit is changing at a pace and in a manner that is unprecedented in human history.  "
"1685",2019,"Ramaphosa","Revolutionary advances in technology are reshaping the way people work and live.  "
"1686",2019,"Ramaphosa","They are transforming the way people relate to each other, the way societies function and the way they are governed.  "
"1687",2019,"Ramaphosa","The devastating effects of global warming on our climate are already being felt, with extreme weather conditions damaging livelihoods, communities and economies.  "
"1688",2019,"Ramaphosa","As a young nation, only 25 years into our democracy, we are faced with a stark choice.  "
"1689",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is a choice between being overtaken by technological change or harnessing it to serve our developmental aspirations.  "
"1690",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is a choice between entrenching inequality or creating shared prosperity through innovation.  "
"1691",2019,"Ramaphosa","Unless we adapt, unless we understand the nature of the profound change that is reshaping our world, and unless we readily embrace the opportunities it presents, the promise of our nation’s birth will forever remain unfulfilled.  "
"1692",2019,"Ramaphosa","Today, we choose to be a nation that is reaching into the future.  "
"1693",2019,"Ramaphosa","In doing so, we are building on a platform of extraordinary scientific achievement.  "
"1694",2019,"Ramaphosa","The successful construction in the Northern Cape of the MeerKAT telescope, the world’s largest and most sensitive radio telescope, and the development of the Square Kilometre Array has enabled South Africa to develop capabilities in areas such as space observation, advanced engineering and supercomputing.  "
"1695",2019,"Ramaphosa","These skills and capabilities are being used to build HERA, a radio telescope designed to detect, for the first time, the distinctive radio signal from the very first stars and galaxies that formed early in the life of the universe.  "
"1696",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is not merely about advancing human understanding of the origins of the universe – it is about responding to the challenges that face South Africans now and into the future.  "
"1697",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is about developing the technology and the capabilities that will build a dynamic and competitive economy that creates decent, sustainable jobs.  "
"1698",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is about enhanced food security, better disease management, and cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy.  "
"1699",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is about smart human settlements and social development solutions built around people’s needs and preferences.   "
"1700",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is about smarter, more responsive, more effective governance.  "
"1701",2019,"Ramaphosa","To ensure that we effectively and with greater urgency harness technological change in pursuit of inclusive growth and social development, I have appointed a Presidential Commission on the 4th Industrial Revolution.  "
"1702",2019,"Ramaphosa","Comprised of eminent persons drawn from different sectors of society, the commission will serve as a national overarching advisory mechanism on digital transformation.  "
"1703",2019,"Ramaphosa","It will identify and recommend policies, strategies and plans that will position South Africa as a global competitive player within the digital revolution space.  "
"1704",2019,"Ramaphosa","Building on the work we have done over the last year, we will focus on further strengthening the capacity of the State.  "
"1705",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have made progress in examining the size and structure of the State, and will complete this work by the end of this administration.  "
"1706",2019,"Ramaphosa","We invite all South Africans to make suggestions on how we can better configure government to serve the needs and the interests of the people.   "
"1707",2019,"Ramaphosa","In improving the capabilities of public servants, the National School of Government is introducing a suite of compulsory courses, covering areas like ethics and anti-corruption, senior management and supply chain management, and deployment of managers to the coal face to strengthen service delivery.  "
"1708",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will process the operationalisation of Section 8 of the Public Administration and Management Act, which strengthens the outlawing of public servants doing business with the State and enable government to deal more effectively with corrupt activities.  "
"1709",2019,"Ramaphosa","This provision will see the imposition of harsher penalties, including fines and/or prison sentences for officials that transgress.   "
"1710",2019,"Ramaphosa","The Ethics, Integrity and Disciplinary Technical Assistance Unit will be established to  strengthen management of ethics and anti-corruption and ensure consequence management for breaches of government processes.  "
"1711",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  South Africa has this year taken up a non-permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council.  "
"1712",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will use this position to advance peace on the continent and across the globe, taking forward Nelson Mandela’s vision of a peaceful, stable and just world.  "
"1713",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  In a few months’ time, South Africans will go to the polls for the sixth time in our democracy to vote for national and provincial governments.  "
"1714",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is an opportunity for our people to exercise their hard-won right to determine the direction of this country.  "
"1715",2019,"Ramaphosa","I have engaged with the Independent Electoral Commission and also with the premiers of all provinces, and intend to proclaim the 8th of May 2019 as the date of the election.  "
"1716",2019,"Ramaphosa","We wish to remind all eligible South Africans who have not yet registered as voters that they still have until the proclamation of the election date to register.  "
"1717",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  We are a people of resilience, of determination and of optimism.   "
"1718",2019,"Ramaphosa","Despite the worst excesses of apartheid, we did not descend into vengeance when our freedom was won.   "
"1719",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our democracy has blossomed and flourished, nurtured by the goodwill of the men and women of this great land, who understand only too well at what cost it was attained.   "
"1720",2019,"Ramaphosa","But the road towards true freedom is a long one, and we have seen divisions in our society grow.   "
"1721",2019,"Ramaphosa","Between black and white, rich and the poor, between rural and urban, between the sexes, and between language groups and cultures.   "
"1722",2019,"Ramaphosa","At times it has seemed that the milk of human kindness that allowed us to reconcile in 1994 had gone sour.  "
"1723",2019,"Ramaphosa","But we will not surrender to the forces of pessimism and defeatism.   "
"1724",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our society is anchored in the roots of tolerance and co-existence, and we stand firm, resolute and united against all and everything that seeks to divide us or destroy our hard-won gains.  "
"1725",2019,"Ramaphosa","They told us building a non-racial South Africa was impossible, and that we would never be able to truly heal from our bitter past.   "
"1726",2019,"Ramaphosa","Yet we weathered the storm, and we are prevailing.  "
"1727",2019,"Ramaphosa","It was the eternal optimism of the human spirit that kept hopes alive during our darkest time.   "
"1728",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is this optimism that will carry us forward as we face a brave new future.  "
"1729",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is a South Africa in which every man, woman and child is provided with the opportunity and means to make a better life for themselves.   "
"1730",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is a South Africa ready to take advantage of the technological changes sweeping the globe to make our economy grow and create jobs for our people.  "
"1731",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is a South Africa whose people have vision, drive and ambition; making it a hub of innovation, entrepreneurship and enterprise.  "
"1732",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is a South Africa that acknowledges the problems of the past, but looks firmly to the future.  "
"1733",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is a South Africa whose leaders are bold and courageous, leaders who remain servants of the people – and for whom fulfilling their duty is the highest, and the only, reward.  "
"1734",2019,"Ramaphosa","Above all, it is a South Africa of which we are all proud of what we have achieved and of where we hope to be.   "
"1735",2019,"Ramaphosa","The task before us is formidable.  "
"1736",2019,"Ramaphosa","Above everything else, we must get our economy working again.  "
"1737",2019,"Ramaphosa","I call upon every South African to make this cause your own.   "
"1738",2019,"Ramaphosa","Because when we succeed – and of this we are certain – it is the entire nation that will benefit.  "
"1739",2019,"Ramaphosa","As government, as business, as labour and as citizens, let us unite to embrace tomorrow.   "
"1740",2019,"Ramaphosa","Let us grasp our collective future with both hands, in the immortal words of the Freedom Charter: side by side, sparing neither strength nor courage.  "
"1741",2019,"Ramaphosa","This task – of building a better South Africa - is our collective task as a nation, as the people of South Africa.   "
"1742",2019,"Ramaphosa","As we approach these tasks and challenges, we should heed the word of Theodore Roosevelt, who said:  “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.   "
"1743",2019,"Ramaphosa","“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”  "
"1744",2019,"Ramaphosa","We all have a role to play as individual South Africans, faith-based organisations, sports organisations, trade unions, business, students, academics and citizens.  "
"1745",2019,"Ramaphosa","Let us continue to embrace the spirit of citizen activism in line with the injunction, Thuma Mina, in the onward march towards equality, freedom and prosperity for all.   "
"1746",2019,"Ramaphosa","I thank you."
"1747",2019,"Ramaphosa","State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise, Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Mr Amos Masondo, Deputy President David Mabuza, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and esteemed members of the Judiciary, Former President, Mr Kgalema Motlanthe, Former President, Mr Thabo Mbeki, Former Speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Frene Ginwala, Former Speaker of the National Assembly, Mr Max Sisulu, Former Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Baleka Mbete, President of the Pan African Parliament, Mr Roger Nkodo Dang, Veterans of the struggle for liberation, Dr Dennis Goldberg, Dr Andrew Mlangeni, Advocate Priscilla Jana, Ms Joyce Dipale, Ms Lillian Keagile, Ms Smally Maqungo, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Premiers and Speakers of provincial legislatures,Chairperson of the South African Local Government Association and Executive Mayors, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Mr Lesetja Kganyago, Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions, Leaders of faith-based organisations, Leaders of academic and research institutions, Members of the diplomatic corps, Invited guests, Honourable members of the National Assembly, Honourable members of the National Council of Provinces, Fellow South Africans,  We gather here at the start of the sixth Democratic Parliament, 106 years to the day after the Natives Land Act – one of the most devastating acts of dispossession, pain and humiliation – came into force.  "
"1748",2019,"Ramaphosa","We recall the words of Sol Plaatje on that tragic event, when he said: “Awakening on Friday morning, June 20, 1913, the South African native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.”  "
"1749",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our people suffered gravely and endured untold hardships as a result of the implementation of the Natives Land Act. "
"1750",2019,"Ramaphosa","The effects of that law are still present with us.  "
"1751",2019,"Ramaphosa","More than a century after that grave injustice, we are called upon to forge a South Africa where no person will be slave or pariah, only free and equal and respected.  "
"1752",2019,"Ramaphosa","We gather here at an extremely difficult and challenging time in the life of our young democracy.  "
"1753",2019,"Ramaphosa","Yet, we are also at a moment in our history that holds great hope and promise.  "
"1754",2019,"Ramaphosa","In 25 years of democracy we have made remarkable progress in building a new nation in which all South Africans have equal rights and broadening opportunities.  "
"1755",2019,"Ramaphosa","Over 25 years, we have done much to meet people’s basic needs, to reduce poverty and to transform a devastated economy that was built to serve the interests of the few.  "
"1756",2019,"Ramaphosa","Working together, we have laid a firm foundation on which we can build a country in which all may know peace and comfort and contentment.  "
"1757",2019,"Ramaphosa","Yet, we also meet at a time when our country is confronted by severe challenges.  "
"1758",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our economy is not growing. "
"1759",2019,"Ramaphosa","Not enough jobs are being created.  "
"1760",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is the concern that rises above all others.  "
"1761",2019,"Ramaphosa","It affects everyone.  "
"1762",2019,"Ramaphosa","It affects you, the young man eMzimhlophe in Soweto, out of school five years now and still not employed.  "
"1763",2019,"Ramaphosa","It impacts you, the single mother from Delft, whose grant supports not just yourself but your grandchildren too.  "
"1764",2019,"Ramaphosa","It also hurts you, the worker in Nelson Mandela Bay, who despite earning a salary is struggling to make ends meet.  "
"1765",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is hard for you, the young student from the Sol Plaatje University in the Northern Cape, who must rely on a thin stipend from your parents to feed yourself.  "
"1766",2019,"Ramaphosa","The lived reality of our people is exactly what I have just described.  "
"1767",2019,"Ramaphosa","Yours are the lived struggles of the people of this nation.  "
"1768",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have heard you, and many others.  "
"1769",2019,"Ramaphosa","Many of us who are representatives elected here spent the better part of the past few months going through the length and breadth of our country, listening to our people.  "
"1770",2019,"Ramaphosa","Sibezwile abantu bakithi, bekhuluma nathi, singena siphuma ezindllini zabo.  "

"1774",2019,"Ramaphosa","Where Mr Groenewald also went, as we saw him travelling through the length and breadth of the country, hey kan ook se dat hy het die mense gehoor.  "
"1775",2019,"Ramaphosa","Sinizwile. "
"1776",2019,"Ramaphosa","Hi swi twile. "
"1777",2019,"Ramaphosa","Ro ni pfa. "
"1778",2019,"Ramaphosa","Re le utlwile. "
"1779",2019,"Ramaphosa","(We have heard you).  "
"1780",2019,"Ramaphosa","Through the elections held in May, you provided all of us with a clear mandate for growth and renewal.  "
"1781",2019,"Ramaphosa","All of us have heard you – myself, Honourable Maimane, Honourable Malema, Honourable Buthelezi, Honourable Groenewald, Honourable Meshoe, Honourable Holomisa, Honourable Zungula, Honourable De Lille, Honourable Magwaza-Msibi, Honourable Galo, Honourable Lekota, Honourable Nyhontso and Honourable Hendricks.                                           "
"1782",2019,"Ramaphosa","The persistent legacy of apartheid has left our country with extreme structural problems – both economic and social.  "
"1783",2019,"Ramaphosa","At the same time, we are having to contend with rapid technological change that is ushering in a new world of work, that is reshaping the global economy and that is redefining social relations.  "
"1784",2019,"Ramaphosa","Together with all the nations of the world, we are confronted by the most devastating changes in global climate in human history.  "
"1785",2019,"Ramaphosa","The extreme weather conditions associated with the warming of the atmosphere threaten our economy, they threaten the lives and the livelihoods of our people, and – unless we act now – will threaten our very existence.  "
"1786",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have heard the voices of the young people who marched to the Union Buildings last week, urging us to take action to protect our planet.  "
"1787",2019,"Ramaphosa","It was to address these fundamental challenges that we adopted the National Development Plan (NDP) in 2012 to guide our national effort to defeat poverty, unemployment and inequality.  "
"1788",2019,"Ramaphosa","However, with 10 years to go before we reach the year 2030, we have not made nearly enough progress in meeting the NDP targets.  "
"1789",2019,"Ramaphosa","Unless we take extraordinary measures, we will not realise Vision 2030.  "
"1790",2019,"Ramaphosa","This means that we need to prioritise.  "
"1791",2019,"Ramaphosa","We need to focus on those actions that will have the greatest impact, actions that will catalyse faster movement forward, both in the immediate term and over the next 10 years.  "
"1792",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is worth noting that the Medium-Term Strategic Framework for the last five years had more than 1 100 indicators by which we were to measure progress in the implementation of the NDP.  "
"1793",2019,"Ramaphosa","Now is the time to focus on implementation.  "
"1794",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is time to make choices.  "
"1795",2019,"Ramaphosa","Some of these choices may be difficult and some may not please everyone.  "
"1796",2019,"Ramaphosa","In an economy that is not growing, at a time when public finances are limited, we will not be able to do everything at one time.  "
"1797",2019,"Ramaphosa","As we enter this new administration, we will focus on seven priorities:  Economic transformation and job creation Education, skills and health Consolidating the social wage through reliable and quality basic services is another important priority Spatial integration, human settlements and local government Social cohesion and safe communities is another key priority Building a capable, ethical and developmental State A better Africa and world. "
"1798",2019,"Ramaphosa","All our programmes and policies across all departments and agencies will be directed in pursuit of these overarching tasks that we believe will be able to deliver a better life for all South Africans.                                                              "
"1799",2019,"Ramaphosa","At the same time, we must restore the NDP to its place at the centre of our national effort, to make it alive, to make it part of the lived experience of the South African people.  "
"1800",2019,"Ramaphosa","At the inauguration, we said that this is a defining moment for our young nation.  "
"1801",2019,"Ramaphosa","A nation that is facing enormous challenges. "
"1802",2019,"Ramaphosa","A nation that consist of 57 million people who stood up over the years and defeated one of the most terrible systems ever put together by human beings, apartheid. "
"1803",2019,"Ramaphosa","A nation of people with courage. "
"1804",2019,"Ramaphosa","A nation of people with great commitment.   "
"1805",2019,"Ramaphosa","We also said that it is through our actions now that we will determine our destiny.  "
"1806",2019,"Ramaphosa","As South Africa enters the next 25 years of democracy, and in pursuit of the objectives of the NDP, let us proclaim a bold and ambitious goal, a unifying purpose, to which we dedicate all our resources and energies.  "
"1807",2019,"Ramaphosa","As we enter the last decade of Vision 2030, let us even more clearly define the South Africa we want and agree on the concrete actions we need to achieve them.  "
"1808",2019,"Ramaphosa","To ensure that our efforts are directed, I am suggesting that, within the priorities of this administration, we agree on five fundamental goals for the next decade, which are part of these seven priorities.  "
"1809",2019,"Ramaphosa","Let us agree, as a nation and as a people united in our aspirations, that within the next 10 years we will have made progress in tackling poverty, inequality and unemployment, where:  No person in South Africa will go hungry. "
"1810",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is a bold plan which I believe we will achieve. "
"1811",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our economy will grow at a much faster rate than our population. "
"1812",2019,"Ramaphosa","Two million more young people will be in employment. "
"1813",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our schools will have better educational outcomes and every 10-year-old will be able to read for meaning. "
"1814",2019,"Ramaphosa","Violent crime will be halved, if not eliminated. "
"1815",2019,"Ramaphosa","Let us make these commitments now – to ourselves and to each other – knowing that they will stretch our resources and capabilities, but understanding that if we achieve these five goals, we will have fundamentally transformed our society.  "
"1816",2019,"Ramaphosa","We set these ambitious goals not despite the severe difficulties of the present, but because of them.  "
"1817",2019,"Ramaphosa","We set these goals so that the decisions we take now are bolder and we act with greater urgency.  "
"1818",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our determination that within the next decade no person in South Africa will go hungry is fundamental to our effort to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality.  "
"1819",2019,"Ramaphosa","In addition to creating employment and other economic opportunities, this means that we must strengthen the social wage and reduce the cost of living.  "
"1820",2019,"Ramaphosa","It means we must improve the affordability, safety and integration of commuter transport for low-income households.  "
"1821",2019,"Ramaphosa","While we have made great progress in providing housing, many South Africans still need land to build homes and earn livelihoods.  "
"1822",2019,"Ramaphosa","In the next five years, we will accelerate the provision of well-located housing and land to poor South Africans.  "
"1823",2019,"Ramaphosa","To improve the quality of life of South Africans, to reduce poverty in all its dimensions and to strengthen our economy, we will attend to the health of our people.  "
"1824",2019,"Ramaphosa","We must attend to the capacity of our hospitals and clinics.  "
"1825",2019,"Ramaphosa","An 80-year-old grandmother cannot and should not spend an entire day in a queue waiting for her medication.  "
"1826",2019,"Ramaphosa","An ill patient cannot be turned away because there is a shortage of doctors and nurses.  "
"1827",2019,"Ramaphosa","A woman in labour cannot have her unborn child’s life put in danger because the ambulance has taken too long to arrive.  "
"1828",2019,"Ramaphosa","As part of the work we must urgently do to improve the quality of the health system, we are finalising the Presidential Health Summit Compact, which draws on the insights and will mobilise the capabilities of all key stakeholders to address the crisis in our clinics and hospitals.  "
"1829",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are far advanced in revising the National Health Insurance (NHI) detailed plan of implementation, including accelerating quality of care initiatives in public facilities, building human resource capacity, establishment of the NHI Fund structure, and costing the administration of the NHI Fund.  "
"1830",2019,"Ramaphosa","We remain concerned about rising HIV infections rates, particularly among young women, and the relatively low numbers of men testing for HIV and starting treatment.  "
"1831",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will intensify our work to implement the 90-90-90 Strategy to end HIV as a public health threat, which includes increasing the number of people on treatment by at least another two million by December 2020.  "
"1832",2019,"Ramaphosa","If we are to successfully address the challenge of poverty across society, we need to provide skills and create economic opportunities for persons with disabilities.  "
"1833",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is therefore a matter of great concern that there are around half a million children of school-going age with disabilities who are not in school.  "
"1834",2019,"Ramaphosa","In responding to these challenges, we have moved the coordination of disability initiatives to the centre of government, in The Presidency.  "
"1835",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have revived the Presidential Working Group on Disability, and will submit the Protocol on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Africa to Parliament this year for ratification.  "
"1836",2019,"Ramaphosa","To address the problems of the working poor, the national minimum wage has been in place for six months and the early indications are that many companies are complying.  "
"1837",2019,"Ramaphosa","The National Minimum Wage Commission is expected to conclude research on the impact of the minimum wage on employment, poverty, inequality and wage differentials by the end of September 2019.  "
"1838",2019,"Ramaphosa","We cannot turn our fortunes around without a relentless focus on economic growth.  "
"1839",2019,"Ramaphosa","Within the next decade, it is our ambition that our economy should be growing at a rate far greater than our population.  "
"1840",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is only when we reach consistently high rates of growth that we will be able to reverse the economic damage of our past.  "
"1841",2019,"Ramaphosa","We make this assertion at a time when the economic outlook is extremely weak.  "
"1842",2019,"Ramaphosa","Following the sharp contraction in growth in the first quarter, the reserve bank now projects that growth in 2019 is likely to be lower than anticipated in the February Budget.  "
"1843",2019,"Ramaphosa","One reason for the lacklustre economic performance has been the load shedding early this year, together with the continued uncertainty in the supply of electricity and the state of Eskom.  "
"1844",2019,"Ramaphosa","The lesson is clear: for growth, we need a reliable and sustainable supply of electricity.  "
"1845",2019,"Ramaphosa","Eskom is facing serious financial, operational and structural problems.  "
"1846",2019,"Ramaphosa","Since the load shedding earlier this year, Eskom has made much progress in implementing its Nine-Point Plan, ensuring better maintenance of its generation fleet, reducing costs and ensuring adequate reserves of coal.  "
"1847",2019,"Ramaphosa","In line with the recommendations of both the Eskom Sustainability Task Team and the Technical Review Team, Eskom is deploying its most skilled and experienced personnel to where they are needed most.  "
"1848",2019,"Ramaphosa","The utility’s financial position remains a matter of grave concern.  "
"1849",2019,"Ramaphosa","With the current committed funding from government, outlined in the 2019 Budget, Eskom has sufficient cash to meet its obligations until the end of October 2019.  "
"1850",2019,"Ramaphosa","For Eskom to default on its loans will cause a cross-default on its remaining debt and would have a huge impact on the already constrained fiscus.  "
"1851",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will, therefore, have to address this matter by  tabling a Special Appropriation Bill on an urgent basis to allocate a significant portion of the R230 billion fiscal support that Eskom will require over the next 10 years in the early years.  "
"1852",2019,"Ramaphosa","This we must do because Eskom is too vital to our economy to be allowed to fail. "
"1853",2019,"Ramaphosa","Eskom is our collective responsibility as a nation and we must ensure that we support it.  "
"1854",2019,"Ramaphosa","Further details will be provided by the Minister of Finance in due course.  "
"1855",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will announce the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, following the stepping down of Mr Phakamani Hadebe. "
"1856",2019,"Ramaphosa","He came in at a very difficult time at Eskom and has done a great deal together with the board led by Mr Jabu Mabuza to stabilise the company.  "
"1857",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will soon also be appointing a Chief Restructuring Officer, who will be expected to reposition Eskom financially with careful attention to the mix between revenue, debt and cost structure of the company.  "
"1858",2019,"Ramaphosa","Eskom is also working with government and other stakeholders to address its broad structural plan and its overall debt as well as the debt owed by municipalities and individual users.  "
"1859",2019,"Ramaphosa","As a country, we must assert the principle that those who use electricity must pay for it.  "
"1860",2019,"Ramaphosa","Failure to pay endangers our entire electricity supply, our economy and our efforts to create jobs.  "
"1861",2019,"Ramaphosa","The days of boycotting payment are over. "
"1862",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is now the time to build, it is the time for all of us to make our own contribution.  "
"1863",2019,"Ramaphosa","So, we call on all our people who use electricity to pay so that Eskom can be able to deliver.  "
"1864",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  To meet our growth targets, we will rebuild the foundations of our economy by revitalising and expanding the productive sectors.  "
"1865",2019,"Ramaphosa","This requires us to reimagine our industrial strategy, to unleash private investment and energise the state to boost economic inclusion.  "
"1866",2019,"Ramaphosa","It requires the State to effectively play its role as an enabler that provides basic services and critical infrastructure, a regulator that sets rules that create equitable opportunities for all players, and a redistributor that ensures that the most vulnerable in society are protected and given a chance to live up to their full potential.  "
"1867",2019,"Ramaphosa","There is another role we want the State to play, that is the entrepreneurial role. "
"1868",2019,"Ramaphosa","A role where a State is able to take some risks and enable the economy to grow.  "
"1869",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will give priority attention to the economic sectors that have the greatest potential for growth.  "
"1870",2019,"Ramaphosa","Drawing on our successes in the automotive sector, we will implement master plans developed with business and labour in industries like clothing and textiles, gas, chemicals and plastics, renewables, and steel and metals fabrication sectors.  "
"1871",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are going to substantially expand the agriculture and agro-processing sector by supporting key value chains and products, developing new markets and reducing our reliance on agricultural imports.  "
"1872",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will bolster the mining industry by developing markets for South African minerals through targeted beneficiation, reduced costs of inputs, and increased research and development.  "
"1873",2019,"Ramaphosa","Through spatial interventions like special economic zones, reviving local industrial parks, business centres, digital hubs and township and village enterprises, we will bring economic development to local areas. "
"1874",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will also focus on small and medium enterprises in our cities, townships and rural areas and create market places where they trade their products.  "
"1875",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will make good on our ambition to more than double international tourist arrivals to 21 million by 2030.  "
"1876",2019,"Ramaphosa","This will be achieved through the renewal of the country’s brand, introducing a world-class visa regime and a significant focus on Chinese and Indian markets and air arrivals from the rest of our continent.  "
"1877",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are determined to ensure that tourists who come to our country are safe.  "
"1878",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will expand our high-tech industry by ensuring that the legal and regulatory framework promotes innovation, scaling up skills development for young people in new technologies, and reducing data costs. "
"1879",2019,"Ramaphosa","Wherever we have gone, young people have continuously raised the issue of the excessive high data costs in South Africa.  "
"1880",2019,"Ramaphosa","To provide impetus to this process, within the next month, the Minister of Communications will issue the policy direction to the Independent Communication Authority of South Africa to commence the spectrum licensing process.  "
"1881",2019,"Ramaphosa","This process will include measures to promote competition, transformation, inclusive growth of the sector and universal access.  "
"1882",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is a vital part of bringing down the costs of data, which is essential both for economic development and for unleashing opportunities for young people.  "
"1883",2019,"Ramaphosa","We call on the telecommunications industry to further bring down the cost of data so that it is in line with the pricing of other countries in the world.  "
"1884",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are intensifying our investment drive.  "
"1885",2019,"Ramaphosa","Of the R300 billion of investments announced at our inaugural Investment Conference last year, just over R250 billion worth of projects has entered implementation phase.  "
"1886",2019,"Ramaphosa","We continue to build a pipeline of investments, which will be showcased at the second South African Investment Conference to be held from 5 to 7 November.  "
"1887",2019,"Ramaphosa","At a time of uncertainty, the work of the investment envoys has built important bridges between government and the business community.  "
"1888",2019,"Ramaphosa","From their feedback, it is clear that much more still needs to be done to improve the investment climate.  "
"1889",2019,"Ramaphosa","This includes reviewing the way government coordinates work to resolve challenges faced by investors and reforming our investment promotion policy and architecture.  "
"1890",2019,"Ramaphosa","Good progress has been made through the Public-Private Growth Initiative, which is being championed by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Mr Roelf Meyer and Dr Johan van Zyl Slabbert.  "
"1891",2019,"Ramaphosa","The private sector has committed to invest R840 billion in 43 projects over 19 sectors and creating 155 000 jobs in the next five years.  "
"1892",2019,"Ramaphosa","In discussions with business, government has committed to remove the policy impediments and accelerate implementation of these projects.  "
"1893",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are urgently working on a set of priority reforms to improve the ease of doing business by consolidating and streamlining regulatory processes, automating permit and other applications, and reducing the cost of compliance.  "
"1894",2019,"Ramaphosa","Infrastructure is a critical area of investment that supports structural transformation, growth and job creation.  "
"1895",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is essential to our economic rejuvenation, to giving meaning and effect to our new dawn.  "
"1896",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our new approach to infrastructure development is based on stronger partnerships between the public and private sectors, and with local communities.  "
"1897",2019,"Ramaphosa","It includes a special package of financial and institutional measures to boost construction and prioritise water infrastructure, roads and student accommodation through a more efficient use of budgeted money.  "
"1898",2019,"Ramaphosa","As announced in the previous SoNA, government has set aside R100 billion to seed the Infrastructure Fund.  "
"1899",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are working to institutionalise the fund, which will be managed by the Development Bank of Southern Africa, with the newly configured Department of Public Works and Infrastructure playing an oversight role.  "
"1900",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have been doing this in consultation with private investors, such as pension funds, who are enthusiastic about participating in the Infrastructure Fund.  "
"1901",2019,"Ramaphosa","These reforms will ensure better planning of infrastructure projects, rigorous feasibility and preparatory work, improved strategic management, impeccable execution and better governance.  "
"1902",2019,"Ramaphosa","This will provide a much-need boost to the construction sector which has been in the doldrums for a while.  "
"1903",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will stimulate local demand and grow South African manufacturing by making sure the ‘Buy Local’ campaign is everywhere and ever-present.  "
"1904",2019,"Ramaphosa","We call on all South Africans to deliberately and consistently buy locally-made goods.  "
"1905",2019,"Ramaphosa","The suit, the shirt and the tie I am wearing today was locally made by South African textile workers at the House of Monatic, here in Salt River Cape Town.  "
"1906",2019,"Ramaphosa","Let us all buy locally-made goods to drive up demand in our economy.  "
"1907",2019,"Ramaphosa","Within this next year, we seek to conclude agreements with retailers to stock more South African goods on their shelves and to actively promote the great products made by South African workers.  "
"1908",2019,"Ramaphosa","At the same time, we will promote our products more actively to the rest of the African continent and the world.  "
"1909",2019,"Ramaphosa","These measures are underpinned by our strong commitment to a macroeconomic and fiscal policy framework that will continue to boost confidence and investment.  "
"1910",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are committed to prudent borrowing and stringent expenditure management to stabilise our public finances and lower the debt trajectory.  "
"1911",2019,"Ramaphosa","The South African Reserve Bank is a critical institution of our democracy, enjoying wide credibility and standing within the country and internationally.  "
"1912",2019,"Ramaphosa","Price stability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for economic growth.  "
"1913",2019,"Ramaphosa","Rising prices of goods and services erode the purchasing power of all South Africans, but especially that of the poor.  "
"1914",2019,"Ramaphosa","Inflation further undermines the competitiveness of our exports and our import-competing firms, putting industries and jobs at risk.  "
"1915",2019,"Ramaphosa","For these reasons, our Constitution mandates the South African Reserve Bank to protect the value of our currency in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth.  "
"1916",2019,"Ramaphosa","Today, we reaffirm this constitutional mandate, which the reserve bank must pursue independently, without fear, favour or prejudice.  "
"1917",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our Constitution also requires that there should be regular consultation between the reserve bank and the Minister of Finance to promote macroeconomic coordination, all in the interests of employment creation and economic growth.  "
"1918",2019,"Ramaphosa","If we are to be internationally competitive, if we are to attract investment, we must address the high cost of doing business in South Africa, and complicated and lengthy regulatory processes.  "
"1919",2019,"Ramaphosa","We must reach a point where no company should wait more than six months for a permit or licence and new companies should be able to be registered within a day.  "
"1920",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to reduce the cost of doing business by reducing port export tariffs, pursuing lowest cost electricity generation options, and making rail transport more competitive and efficient.  "
"1921",2019,"Ramaphosa","Guided by the NDP, it is our responsibility to pursue inclusive, sustainable development that is resilient in the face of climate change.  "
"1922",2019,"Ramaphosa","Working in partnership with the private sector, labour and the international community we will step up our adaptation and mitigation efforts.  "
"1923",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have the opportunity to be at the forefront of green growth, of low-carbon industrialisation, of pioneering new technologies and of taking quantum leaps towards the economy of the future.  "
"1924",2019,"Ramaphosa","We must increase the contribution of renewable and clean energy to our national energy mix and explore the potential of the hydrogen economy.  "
"1925",2019,"Ramaphosa","Faster economic growth also requires accelerated land reform in rural and urban areas and a clear property rights regime.  "
"1926",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have received the report of the Presidential Advisory Panel on Land Reform and Agriculture, which was led by the Deputy President, which will now be presented to Cabinet for consideration.  "
"1927",2019,"Ramaphosa","The panel’s recommendations will inform the finalisation of a comprehensive, far-reaching and transformative land reform programme.  "
"1928",2019,"Ramaphosa","In the immediate term, government will accelerate efforts to identify and release public land that is suitable for smart, urban settlements and for farming.  "
"1929",2019,"Ramaphosa","In the stimulus and recovery package announced last year, we promised to prioritise funding for emerging farmers.  "
"1930",2019,"Ramaphosa","Over the medium-term budget period, R3.9 billion has been allocated to the Land Bank to support black commercial farmers.  "
"1931",2019,"Ramaphosa","An essential part of South Africa’s growth strategy is the integration of our economy with those of our neighbours and the rest of our continent.  "
"1932",2019,"Ramaphosa","The African Continental Free Trade Area will improve the movement of goods and services, capital and means of production across the continent.  "
"1933",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our revitalised industrial strategy focuses on the expansion of our trade and investment links with the rest of the Southern African region and the continent at large.  "
"1934",2019,"Ramaphosa","Within the Southern African Development Community, we will prioritise development of cross-border value chains in key sectors such as energy, mining and mineral beneficiation, manufacturing, infrastructure and agro-processing.  "
"1935",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  The growth of our economy will have little value unless it creates employment on a far greater scale.  "
"1936",2019,"Ramaphosa","The fact that the unemployment rate among young South Africans is more than 50% is essentially a national crisis that demands urgent, innovative and coordinated solutions where all of us should see it as a requirement to work together.  "
"1937",2019,"Ramaphosa","And because more young people are entering the labour force every year, the economy needs to create far more jobs for youth than it currently does; merely to keep the youth unemployment rate steady.  "
"1938",2019,"Ramaphosa","The brutal reality is that when it comes to youth unemployment, we have to run just to remain in the same place.  "
"1939",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is therefore essential that we proceed without delay to implement a comprehensive plan – driven and coordinated from The Presidency – to create no fewer than two million new jobs for young people within the next decade.  "
"1940",2019,"Ramaphosa","This plan will work across government departments and all three tiers of government, in partnership with the private sector.  "
"1941",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are already working with the private sector to create pathways into work for young people through scaling up existing pathway management networks.  "
"1942",2019,"Ramaphosa","These are networks that allow young people who opt in increased visibility, network support and opportunities to signal their availability for jobs and self-employment.  "
"1943",2019,"Ramaphosa","They make sure that youth from poorer households – and young women in particular – are empowered to take up the new opportunities.  "
"1944",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government will continue to provide employment through the Expanded Public Works Programme, especially in labour intensive areas like maintenance, clearing vegetation, plugging water leaks and constructing roads.  "
"1945",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to develop programmes to ensure that economically excluded young people are work ready and absorbed into sectors where ‘jobs demand’ is growing.  "
"1946",2019,"Ramaphosa","These sectors include global business processing services, agricultural value chains, technical installation, repair and maintenance and new opportunities provided through the digital economy and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  "
"1947",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government will also ensure that young people are employed in social economy jobs such as early childhood development and health care.  "
"1948",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will expand the National Youth Service to take on 50 000 young people a year.  "
"1949",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government will support tech-enabled platforms for self-employed youth in rural areas and townships.  "
"1950",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will expand our programmes to enable young people to gain paid workplace experience through initiatives like the Youth Employment Service, and also facilitating work-based internships.  "
"1951",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are going to roll out small business incubation centres to provide youth-driven start-ups with financial and technical advice as they begin their journeys.  "
"1952",2019,"Ramaphosa","Yesterday, I had the great privilege to meet and engage in dialogue with several young South Africans who are doing simply amazing work to build our country and develop our people.  "
"1953",2019,"Ramaphosa","They are entrepreneurs and community builders, activists and artists.  "
"1954",2019,"Ramaphosa","If there is one thing we have learned from our engagements with this country’s youth is that we cannot impose our solutions on them: everything we have to do must be led by young people themselves.  "
"1955",2019,"Ramaphosa","They have told us what they want, and what they need.  "
"1956",2019,"Ramaphosa","They want to be employed, yes, but they also want to become employers.  "
"1957",2019,"Ramaphosa","They are brimming with ideas, they are at the forefront of innovation, and they want to do things for themselves.  "
"1958",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have to support the fire of entrepreneurship because the fortunes of this country depend on the energies and creative talent of our young people.  "
"1959",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  If we are to ensure that within the next decade, every 10-year-old will be able to read for meaning, we will need to mobilise the entire nation behind a massive reading campaign.  "
"1960",2019,"Ramaphosa","Early reading is the basic foundation that determines a child’s educational progress, through school, through higher education and into the workplace.  "
"1961",2019,"Ramaphosa","All other interventions – from the work being done to improve the quality of basic education to the provision of free higher education for the poor, from our investment in Technical and Vocational Education Training colleges to the expansion of workplace learning – will not produce the results we need unless we first ensure that children can read.  "
"1962",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is through initiatives like the National Reading Coalition that we will be able to coordinate this national effort.  "
"1963",2019,"Ramaphosa","All foundation and intermediate phase teachers are to be trained to teach reading in English and the African languages, and we are training and deploying a cohort of experienced coaches to provide high quality on-site support to teachers.  "
"1964",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are implementing the Early Grade Reading Programme, which consists of an integrated package of lesson plans, additional reading materials and professional support to Foundation Phase teachers.  "
"1965",2019,"Ramaphosa","This forms part of the broader efforts to strengthen the basic education system by empowering school leadership teams, improving the capabilities of teachers and ensuring a more consistent measurement of progress for grades three, six and nine.  "
"1966",2019,"Ramaphosa","We also have to prepare our young people for the jobs of the future.  "
"1967",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is why we are introducing subjects like coding and data analytics at a primary school level.  "
"1968",2019,"Ramaphosa","Honourable members,  The South Africa we want is a country where all people are safe and feel safe.  "
"1969",2019,"Ramaphosa","Let us therefore, work together to ensure that violent crime is at least halved over the next decade.  "
"1970",2019,"Ramaphosa","The first step is to increase police visibility by employing more policewomen and men, and also to create a more active role for citizens through effective community policing forums.  "
"1971",2019,"Ramaphosa","Currently, there are over 5 000 students registered for basic training in our police training colleges and we envisage that this number will be increased to 7 000 per cycle over the next two intakes.  "
"1972",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are working to improve success rates in investigating and prosecuting crimes, and to ensure better training and professionalisation throughout the criminal justice system.  "
"1973",2019,"Ramaphosa","Violent crime is a societal problem that requires a society-wide response.  "
"1974",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are working with civil society organisations on strategies to end gender-based violence and femicide.  "
"1975",2019,"Ramaphosa","Following intensive consultations and engagements, we are working towards the establishment of the Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Council and a National Strategic Plan that will guide all of us, wherever we are, in our efforts to eradicate this national scourge.  "
"1976",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are capacitating and equipping the police and court system to support survivors of gender-based violence.  "
"1977",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are stepping up the fight against drug syndicates through the implementation of the National Anti-Gang Strategy and the revised National Drug Master Plan.  "
"1978",2019,"Ramaphosa","Ladies and gentlemen,  Distinguished guests,  The achievement of all these objectives requires a capable and developmental State.  "
"1979",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is a State that not only provides the institutions and infrastructure that enable the economy and society to operate, but that has the means to drive transformation.  "
"1980",2019,"Ramaphosa","Earlier this month, we announced the reconfiguration of a number of government departments to enable them to deliver on their mandates.  "
"1981",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our decision was premised on efficiency, cost-containment, cooperative governance and strategic alignment.  "
"1982",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is the start of a wider process of arresting the decline in State capacity and restructuring our model of service delivery so that it best serves the citizens of our country.  "
"1983",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will be adopting a district-based approach – focusing on the 44 districts and eight metros – to speed up service delivery, ensuring that municipalities are properly supported and adequately resourced.  "
"1984",2019,"Ramaphosa","To ensure that the State is able to effectively enable economic and social development, it is essential that we strengthen our State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).  "
"1985",2019,"Ramaphosa","Through the Presidential SOE Council, government intends to create alignment between all state-owned companies and to better define their respective mandates.  "
"1986",2019,"Ramaphosa","Through the council, we will work with the leadership of SOEs to develop a legal and regulatory environment that promotes innovation and agility and enhances their competitiveness.  "
"1987",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will build on the work we have already begun to address problems of poor governance, inefficiency and financial sustainability.  "
"1988",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are committed to building an ethical State in which there is no place for corruption, patronage, rent-seeking and plundering of public money.  "
"1989",2019,"Ramaphosa","We want a corps of skilled and professional public servants of the highest moral standards – and dedicated to the public service.  "
"1990",2019,"Ramaphosa","The decisive steps we have taken to end state capture and fight corruption, including measures to strengthen the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Special Investigating Unit (SIU), South African Revenue Service and State Security, are achieving important results.  "
"1991",2019,"Ramaphosa","But there is still much more work to do.  "
"1992",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have asked the National Director of Public Prosecutions to develop a plan to significantly increase the capacity and effectiveness of the NPA, including to ensure effective asset forfeiture.  "
"1993",2019,"Ramaphosa","We need to ensure that public money stolen is returned and used to deliver services and much-needed basic infrastructure to the poorest communities.  "
"1994",2019,"Ramaphosa","We expect that the new SIU Special Tribunal will start its work within the next few months to fast-track civil claims arising from SIU investigations, which are currently estimated to be around R14.7 billion.  "
"1995",2019,"Ramaphosa","South Africa will continue to play an active role in international relations in the quest for global peace and security, people-centred development and prosperity for all.  "
"1996",2019,"Ramaphosa","We renew our determination to work in concert with the international community to preserve and protect the rules-based multilateral system with the United Nations (UN) at its head.  "
"1997",2019,"Ramaphosa","We will use our membership of the UN Security Council to promote the peaceful resolution of disputes, particularly on our own continent.  "
"1998",2019,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  If we are to achieve the South Africa we want, we need a new social compact.  "
"1999",2019,"Ramaphosa","We need to forge durable partnerships between government, business, labour, communities and civil society.  "
"2000",2019,"Ramaphosa","This places a responsibility on each of us and all of us.  "
"2001",2019,"Ramaphosa","Government must create an enabling environment, use public resources wisely and invest in developing the country’s human potential.  "
"2002",2019,"Ramaphosa","We would like business to consider the country’s national strategic objectives and social considerations in their decisions and actions.  "
"2003",2019,"Ramaphosa","We agree that labour should advance the interests of workers while, at the same time, promoting the sustainability of businesses and the creation of jobs.  "
"2004",2019,"Ramaphosa","Civil society needs to continue to play its role in holding government to account but must also join us in practical actions to attain our common goals.  "
"2005",2019,"Ramaphosa","We look to the parties in this Parliament to be a vital part of this partnership, lending support, insights and coming up with tangible solutions and efforts to promote the national interest.  "
"2006",2019,"Ramaphosa","This social compact requires a contribution from everyone.  "
"2007",2019,"Ramaphosa","It will also need sacrifices and trade-offs.  "
"2008",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is upon the conduct of each that the fate of all depends.  "
"2009",2019,"Ramaphosa","If we are to reinvigorate the implementation of the NDP, we must cast our sights on the broadest of horizons.  "
"2010",2019,"Ramaphosa","We want a South Africa wherein all enjoy comfort and prosperity.  "
"2011",2019,"Ramaphosa","But we also want a South Africa where we will stretch our capacities to the fullest as we advance along the super highway of progress.  "
"2012",2019,"Ramaphosa","We want a South Africa that has prioritised its rail networks, and is producing high-speed trains connecting our megacities and the remotest areas of our country.  "
"2013",2019,"Ramaphosa","We should imagine a country where bullet trains pass through Johannesburg as they travel from here to Musina, and they stop in Buffalo City on their way from eThekwini back here in Cape Town.  "
"2014",2019,"Ramaphosa","We want a South Africa with a high-tech economy where advances in e-health, robotics and remote medicine are applied as we roll out the NHI.  "
"2015",2019,"Ramaphosa","What type of South Africa do we want?  "
"2016",2019,"Ramaphosa","We want a South Africa that doesn’t simply export its raw materials but has become a manufacturing hub for key components used in electronics, in automobiles and in computers.  "
"2017",2019,"Ramaphosa","We must be a country that can feed itself and that harnesses the latest advances in smart agriculture.  "
"2018",2019,"Ramaphosa","I dream of a South Africa where the first entirely new city built in the democratic era rises, with skyscrapers, schools, universities, hospitals and factories.  "
"2019",2019,"Ramaphosa","This dream that I have has been fuelled by my conversations with four wonderful people: Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Dr Naledi Pandor, Ms Jessie Duarte and President Xi Jinping of China, whose account of how China is building a new city 100 kilometres from Beijing has helped to consolidate my dream.  "
"2020",2019,"Ramaphosa","This is a dream we can all share and participate in building.  "
"2021",2019,"Ramaphosa","We have not built a new city in 25 years of democracy.  "
"2022",2019,"Ramaphosa","Seventy-five percent of South Africans are going to be living in the urban areas by 2030.  "
"2023",2019,"Ramaphosa","The cities of Johannesburg, Tshwane, Cape Town and eThekwini are running out of space to accommodate all those who throng to the cities.  "
"2024",2019,"Ramaphosa","Has the time not arrived for us to be bold and reach beyond ourselves and do what may seem impossible?  "
"2025",2019,"Ramaphosa","Has the time not arrived to build a new smart city founded on the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?  "
"2026",2019,"Ramaphosa","I would like to invite South Africans to begin imaging this prospect.  "
"2027",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are the South African nation that, with its Constitution, gives hope to the hopeless, rights to the dispossessed and marginalised, and comfort and security to its men, women and children.  "
"2028",2019,"Ramaphosa","Though we may have faltered, we have not forgotten who we are, and what we stand for.  "
"2029",2019,"Ramaphosa","We are still that nation.  "
"2030",2019,"Ramaphosa","You may ask how I can be hopeful at such a difficult time.  "
"2031",2019,"Ramaphosa","I am hopeful because I have walked with the people of this country – the nurses and health care workers, our men and women in uniform, the teachers in our schools, the students who despite their family’s hardship are determined to succeed, and the youth who are trying to start their own businesses, to invent and create, and to rise above their circumstances.  "
"2032",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is you who give me courage, and to whom I offer courage in return.  "
"2033",2019,"Ramaphosa","Working together there is nothing we cannot be, nothing we cannot do, and nothing we cannot achieve.  "
"2034",2019,"Ramaphosa","As we enter this new era, let us take to heart the words of Ben Okri, when he says:  Will you be at the harvest, Among the gatherers of new fruits? "
"2035",2019,"Ramaphosa","Then you must begin today to remake Your mental and spiritual world, And join the warriors and celebrants Of freedom, realizers of great dreams. "
"2036",2019,"Ramaphosa","You can’t remake the world Without remaking yourself. "
"2037",2019,"Ramaphosa","Each new era begins within. "
"2038",2019,"Ramaphosa","It is an inward event, With unsuspected possibilities For inner liberation.  "
"2039",2019,"Ramaphosa","We could use it to turn on Our inward lights. "
"2040",2019,"Ramaphosa","We could use it to use even the dark And negative things positively. "
"2041",2019,"Ramaphosa","We could use the new era To clean our eyes, To see the world differently, To see ourselves more clearly. "
"2042",2019,"Ramaphosa","Only free people can make a free world. "
"2043",2019,"Ramaphosa","Infect the world with your light. "
"2044",2019,"Ramaphosa","Help fulfil the golden prophecies. "
"2045",2019,"Ramaphosa","Press forward the human genius. "
"2046",2019,"Ramaphosa","Our future is greater than our past.  "
"2047",2019,"Ramaphosa","I thank you."
"2048",2018,"Ramaphosa"," Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Baleka Mbete, Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Ms Thandi Modise, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, Former President Thabo Mbeki, Former Deputy President FW de Klerk, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and all esteemed members of the judiciary, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Premiers and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures, Chairperson of SALGA and all Executive Mayors present, The Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions, Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders, Leaders of faith based organisations, Former Speaker Dr Frene Ginwala, Former Speaker Mr Max Sisulu, Invited Guests Veterans of the struggle for liberation, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Honourable members, Fellow South Africans,  It is a great honour and privilege to deliver this State of the Nation Address.  "
"2049",2018,"Ramaphosa","This Address should have been delivered last week, but was delayed so that we could properly manage issues of political transition.  "
"2050",2018,"Ramaphosa","I wish to thank Honourable Members and the people of South Africa for their patience and forbearance.  "
"2051",2018,"Ramaphosa","I also wish to extend a word of gratitude to former President Jacob Zuma for the manner in which he approached this difficult and sensitive process.  "
"2052",2018,"Ramaphosa","I wish to thank him for his service to the nation during his two terms as President of the Republic, during which the country made significant progress in several areas of development.  "
"2053",2018,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  In just over 150 days from now, the peoples of the world will unite in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.  "
"2054",2018,"Ramaphosa","It is a day on which we, as South Africans, will remember the life of one of the most remarkable leaders this country and this continent – and indeed, the world – has known.  "
"2055",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will recount Madiba’s long walk to freedom, his wisdom, his unfailing humility, his abiding compassion and his essential integrity.  "
"2056",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have dedicated this year to his memory and we will devote our every action, every effort, every utterance to the realisation of his vision of a democratic, just and equitable society.  "
"2057",2018,"Ramaphosa","Guided by his example, we will use this year to reinforce our commitment to ethical behaviour and ethical leadership.  "
"2058",2018,"Ramaphosa","In celebrating the centenary of Nelson Mandela we are not merely honouring the past, we are building the future.  "
"2059",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are continuing the long walk he began, to build a society in which all may be free, in which all may be equal before the law and in which all may share in the wealth of our land and have a better life.  "
"2060",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are building a country where a person’s prospects are determined by their own initiative and hard work, and not by the colour of their skin, place of birth, gender, language or income of their parents.  "
"2061",2018,"Ramaphosa","This year, we also celebrate the centenary of another giant of our struggle, Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu.  "
"2062",2018,"Ramaphosa","Through her remarkable life and outstanding contribution, she defined what it means to be a freedom fighter, a leader and a diligent and disciplined servant of the people.  "
"2063",2018,"Ramaphosa","Through her leadership, she embodied the fundamental link between national liberation and gender emancipation.  "
"2064",2018,"Ramaphosa","As we mark her centenary, we reaffirm that no liberation can be complete and no nation can be free until its women are free.  "
"2065",2018,"Ramaphosa","We honour this son and this daughter of the African soil in a year of change, in a year of renewal, in a year of hope.  "
"2066",2018,"Ramaphosa","We honour them not only in word, but, more importantly, in direct action towards the achievement of their shared vision of a better society.  "
"2067",2018,"Ramaphosa","We should honour Madiba by putting behind us the era of discord, disunity and disillusionment.  "
"2068",2018,"Ramaphosa","We should put behind us the era of diminishing trust in public institutions and weakened confidence in leaders.  "
"2069",2018,"Ramaphosa","We should put all the negativity that has dogged our country behind us because a new dawn is upon us.  "
"2070",2018,"Ramaphosa","It is a new dawn that is inspired by our collective memory of Nelson Mandela and the changes that are unfolding.  "
"2071",2018,"Ramaphosa","As we rid our minds of all negativity, we should reaffirm our belief that South Africa belongs to all who live in it.  "
"2072",2018,"Ramaphosa","For though we are a diverse people, we are one nation.  "
"2073",2018,"Ramaphosa","There are 57 million of us, each with different histories, languages, cultures, experiences, views and interests.  "
"2074",2018,"Ramaphosa","Yet we are bound together by a common destiny.  "
"2075",2018,"Ramaphosa","For this, we owe much to our forebearers – people like Pixley ka Seme, Charlotte Maxeke and Chief Albert Luthuli – who understood the necessity of the unity and harmony of all the people of this great land.  "
"2076",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are a nation at one.  "
"2077",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are one people, committed to work together to find jobs for our youth; to build factories and roads, houses and clinics; to prepare our children for a world of change and progress; to build cities and towns where families may be safe, productive and content.  "
"2078",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are determined to build a society defined by decency and integrity, that does not tolerate the plunder of public resources, nor the theft by corporate criminals of the hard-earned savings of ordinary people.  "
"2079",2018,"Ramaphosa","While there are many issues on which we may differ, on these fundamental matters, we are at one.  "
"2080",2018,"Ramaphosa","We know that there is still a lot that divides us.  "
"2081",2018,"Ramaphosa","We remain a highly unequal society, in which poverty and prosperity are still defined by race and gender.  "
"2082",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have been given the responsibility to build a new nation, to confront the injustices of the past and the inequalities of the present.  "
"2083",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are called upon to do so under difficult conditions.  "
"2084",2018,"Ramaphosa","The state we are in as a nation is that while poverty declined significantly following the democratic breakthrough of 1994, we have seen reverses in recent years.  "
"2085",2018,"Ramaphosa","Poverty levels rose in 2015, unemployment has gone up and inequality has persisted.  "
"2086",2018,"Ramaphosa","For several years our economy has not grown at the pace needed to create enough jobs or lift our people out of poverty.  "
"2087",2018,"Ramaphosa","Public finances have been constrained, limiting the ability of government to expand its investment in economic and social development.  "
"2088",2018,"Ramaphosa","Despite these challenging conditions, we have managed – working together – to achieve progress in improving the lives of our people.  "
"2089",2018,"Ramaphosa","Even under conditions of weak growth, our economy has created jobs, but not at the pace required to absorb new entrants into the labour market.  "
"2090",2018,"Ramaphosa","This means that as we pursue higher levels of economic growth and investment, we need to take additional measures to reduce poverty and meet the needs of the unemployed.  "
"2091",2018,"Ramaphosa","Since the start of the current Parliament, our public employment programmes have created more than 3.2 million work opportunities.  "
"2092",2018,"Ramaphosa","In the context of widespread unemployment, they continue to provide much needed income, work experience and training.  "
"2093",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have taken measures to reduce the cost of living, especially for the poor.  "
"2094",2018,"Ramaphosa","Government’s free basic services programme currently supports more than 3.5 million indigent households.  "
"2095",2018,"Ramaphosa","More than 17 million social grants are paid each month, benefiting nearly a third of the population.  "
"2096",2018,"Ramaphosa","We know, however, that if we are to break the cycle of poverty, we need to educate the children of the poor.  "
"2097",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have insisted that this should start in early childhood.  "
"2098",2018,"Ramaphosa","Today we have nearly a million children in early childhood development facilities.  "
"2099",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are seeing improvements in the outcomes of our basic education system.  "
"2100",2018,"Ramaphosa","The matric pass rate increased from 60.6 percent in 2009 to 75.1 percent last year.  "
"2101",2018,"Ramaphosa","There are currently almost a million students enrolled in higher education, up from just over 500,000 in 1994.                                                                           "
"2102",2018,"Ramaphosa","As we enter a new era, we are determined to build on these achievements, confront the challenges we face and accelerate progress in building a more prosperous and equitable society.  "
"2103",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have seen a moderate recovery in our economy and a broader, sustained recovery in the global economy.  "
"2104",2018,"Ramaphosa","Commodity prices have improved, the stock market has risen, the rand has strengthened and there are early indications that investor confidence is on the rise.  "
"2105",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have taken decisive measures to address concerns about political instability and are committed to ensure policy certainty and consistency.  "
"2106",2018,"Ramaphosa","There is a greater sense of optimism among our people.  "
"2107",2018,"Ramaphosa","Our people are hopeful about the future.  "
"2108",2018,"Ramaphosa","Business confidence among South African companies has improved and foreign investors are looking anew at opportunities in our country.  "
"2109",2018,"Ramaphosa","Some financial institutions have identified South Africa as one of the hot emerging markets for 2018.  "
"2110",2018,"Ramaphosa","Our task, as South Africans, is to seize this moment of hope and renewal, and to work together to ensure that it makes a meaningful difference in the lives of our people.  "
"2111",2018,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will be initiating measures to set the country on a new path of growth, employment and transformation.  "
"2112",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will do this by getting social partners in our country to collaborate in building a social compact on which we will create drivers of economic recovery.  "
"2113",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have to build further on the collaboration with business and labour to restore confidence and prevent an investment downgrade.  "
"2114",2018,"Ramaphosa","Tough decisions have to be made to close our fiscal gap, stabilise our debt and restore our state-owned enterprises to health.  "
"2115",2018,"Ramaphosa","At the centre of our national agenda in 2018 is the creation of jobs, especially for the youth.  "
"2116",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are going to embark on a number of measures to address the unemployment challenge.  "
"2117",2018,"Ramaphosa","One of the initiatives will be to convene a Jobs Summit within the next few months to align the efforts of every sector and every stakeholder behind the imperative of job creation.  "
"2118",2018,"Ramaphosa","The summit will look at what we need to do to ensure our economy grows and becomes more productive, that companies invest on a far greater scale, that workers are better equipped, and that our economic infrastructure is expanded.  "
"2119",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will expect this summit to come up with practical solutions and initiatives that will be implemented immediately.  "
"2120",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will make a major push this year to encourage significant new investment in our economy.  "
"2121",2018,"Ramaphosa","To this end, we will organise an Investment Conference in the next three months, targeting both domestic and international investors, to market the compelling investment opportunities to be found in our country.  "
"2122",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are going to address the decline over many years of our manufacturing capacity, which has deeply affected employment and exports.  "
"2123",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will seek to re-industrialise on a scale and at a pace that draws millions of job seekers into the economy.  "
"2124",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are going to promote greater investment in key manufacturing sectors through the strategic use of incentives and other measures.  "
"2125",2018,"Ramaphosa","To further stimulate manufacturing, we will forge ahead with the localisation programme, through which products like textile, clothing, furniture, rail rolling stock and water meters are designated for local procurement.  "
"2126",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have already spent more than R57 billion on locally-produced goods that may have been imported from other countries.  "
"2127",2018,"Ramaphosa","Special economic zones remain important instruments we will use to attract strategic foreign and domestic direct investment and build targeted industrial capabilities and establish new industrial hubs.  "
"2128",2018,"Ramaphosa","The process of industrialisation must be underpinned by transformation.  "
"2129",2018,"Ramaphosa","Through measures like preferential procurement and the black industrialists programme, we are developing a new generation of black and women producers that are able to build enterprises of significant scale and capability.  "
"2130",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will improve our capacity to support black professionals, deal decisively with companies that resist transformation, use competition policy to open markets up to new black entrants, and invest in the development of businesses in townships and rural areas.  "
"2131",2018,"Ramaphosa","Radical economic transformation requires that we fundamentally improve the position of black women and communities in the economy, ensuring that they are owners, managers, producers and financiers.  "
"2132",2018,"Ramaphosa","Our most grave and most pressing challenge is youth unemployment.  "
"2133",2018,"Ramaphosa","It is therefore a matter of great urgency that we draw young people in far greater numbers into productive economic activity.  "
"2134",2018,"Ramaphosa","Young South Africans will be moved to the centre of our economic agenda.  "
"2135",2018,"Ramaphosa","They are already forming a greater proportion of the labour force on our infrastructure projects and are the primary beneficiaries of programmes such as the installation of solar water heaters and the war on leaks.  "
"2136",2018,"Ramaphosa","We continue to draw young people in far greater numbers into productive economic activity through programmes such as the Employment Tax Incentive.  "
"2137",2018,"Ramaphosa","Working in partnership with business, organised labour and community representatives, we are creating opportunities for young people to be exposed to the world of work through internships, apprenticeships, mentorship and entrepreneurship.  "
"2138",2018,"Ramaphosa","Next month, we will launch the Youth Employment Service initiative, which will place unemployed youth in paid internships in companies across the economy.  "
"2139",2018,"Ramaphosa","Together with our partners in business, we have agreed to create a million such internships in the next three years.  "
"2140",2018,"Ramaphosa","If we are to respond effectively to the needs of youth, it is essential that young people articulate their views and are able to engage with government at the highest level.  "
"2141",2018,"Ramaphosa","I will therefore be establishing a Youth Working Group that is representative of all young South Africans to ensure that our policies and programmes advance their interests.  "
"2142",2018,"Ramaphosa","Infrastructure investment is key to our efforts to grow the economy, create jobs, empower small businesses and provide services to our people.  "
"2143",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have invested heavily in new roads, power stations, schools and other infrastructure.  "
"2144",2018,"Ramaphosa","As some of our projects are taking time to get off the ground and to enhance our efforts, I will assemble a team to speed up implementation of new projects, particularly water projects, health facilities and road maintenance.  "
"2145",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have learnt some valuable lessons from our experience in building all the new infrastructure, which will inform our way ahead.  "
"2146",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will focus on improvements in our budget and monitoring systems, improve the integration of projects and build a broad compact on infrastructure with business and organised labour.  "
"2147",2018,"Ramaphosa","Mining is another area that has massive unrealised potential for growth and job creation is mining.  "
"2148",2018,"Ramaphosa","We need to see mining as a sunrise industry.  "
"2149",2018,"Ramaphosa","With the revival in commodity prices, we are determined to work with mining companies, unions and communities to grow the sector, attract new investment, create jobs and set the industry on a new path of transformation and sustainability.  "
"2150",2018,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will intensify engagements with all stakeholders on the Mining Charter to ensure that it is truly an effective instrument to sustainably transform the face of mining in South Africa.  "
"2151",2018,"Ramaphosa","By working together, in a genuine partnership, underscored by trust and a shared vision, I am certain we will be able to resolve the current impasse and agree on a Charter that both accelerates transformation and grows this vital sector of our economy.  "
"2152",2018,"Ramaphosa","Processing of the MPRDA Amendment Bill through both houses of parliament is at an advanced stage, with an indication by Parliament that the Bill will reasonably be finalised during the first quarter of 2018.  "
"2153",2018,"Ramaphosa","The Bill, once enacted into law, will entrench existing regulatory certainty, provide for security of tenure and advance the socio-economic interests of all South Africans.  "
"2154",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are extremely concerned about the rise in mining fatalities last year.  "
"2155",2018,"Ramaphosa","We call on mining companies to work together with all stakeholders to ensure that mine accidents are dramatically reduced.  "
"2156",2018,"Ramaphosa","One mining fatality is one too many.  "
"2157",2018,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Ultimately, the growth of our economy will be sustained by small businesses, as is the case in many countries.  "
"2158",2018,"Ramaphosa","It is our shared responsibility to grow this vital sector of the economy.  "
"2159",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will work with our social partners to build a small business support ecosystem that assists, nourishes and promotes entrepreneurs.  "
"2160",2018,"Ramaphosa","Government will honour its undertaking to set aside at least 30 percent of public procurement to SMMEs, cooperatives and township and rural enterprises.  "
"2161",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will continue to invest in small business incubation.  "
"2162",2018,"Ramaphosa","We encourage business to do the same.  "
"2163",2018,"Ramaphosa","The establishment through the CEOs Initiative of a small business fund – which currently stands at R1.5 billion – is an outstanding example of the role that the private sector can play.  "
"2164",2018,"Ramaphosa","Government is finalising a small business and innovation fund targeted at start-ups.  "
"2165",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will reduce the regulatory barriers for small businesses.  "
"2166",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are also working to expand economic opportunities for people with disabilities.  "
"2167",2018,"Ramaphosa","Among other things, the Small Enterprise Finance Agency – SEFA – has launched a scheme to develop and fund entrepreneurs with disabilities called the Amavulandlela Funding Scheme.  "
"2168",2018,"Ramaphosa","Agriculture presents one of the greatest opportunities to significantly grow our economy and create jobs.  "
"2169",2018,"Ramaphosa","Agriculture made the largest contribution, by a significant margin, to the improved growth of our economy in the second and third quarters of 2017.  "
"2170",2018,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will take decisive action to realise the enormous economic potential of agriculture.  "
"2171",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will accelerate our land redistribution programme not only to redress a grave historical injustice, but also to bring more producers into the agricultural sector and to make more land available for cultivation.  "
"2172",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will pursue a comprehensive approach that makes effective use of all the mechanisms at our disposal.  "
"2173",2018,"Ramaphosa","Guided by the resolutions of the 54th National Conference of the governing party, this approach will include the expropriation of land without compensation.  "
"2174",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are determined that expropriation without compensation should be implemented in a way that increases agricultural production, improves food security and ensure that the land is returned to those from whom it was taken under colonialism and apartheid.  "
"2175",2018,"Ramaphosa","Government will undertake a process of consultation to determine the modalities of the implementation of this resolution.  "
"2176",2018,"Ramaphosa","We make a special call to financial institutions to be our partners in mobilising resources to accelerate the land redistribution programme as increased investment will be needed in this sector.  "
"2177",2018,"Ramaphosa","Tourism is another area which provides our country with incredible opportunities to, quite literally, shine.  "
"2178",2018,"Ramaphosa","Tourism currently sustains 700,000 direct jobs and is performing better than most other growth sectors.  "
"2179",2018,"Ramaphosa","There is no reason why it can’t double in size.  "
"2180",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have the most beautiful country in the world and the most hospitable people.  "
"2181",2018,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will enhance support for destination marketing in key tourism markets and take further measures to reduce regulatory barriers and develop emerging tourism businesses.  "
"2182",2018,"Ramaphosa","We call on all South Africans to open their homes and their hearts to the world.  "
"2183",2018,"Ramaphosa","Our prosperity as a nation depends on our ability to take full advantage rapid technological change.  "
"2184",2018,"Ramaphosa","This means that we urgently need to develop our capabilities in the areas of science, technology and innovation.  "
"2185",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will soon establish a Digital Industrial Revolution Commission, which will include the private sector and civil society, to ensure that our country is in a position to seize the opportunities and manage the challenges of rapid advances in information and communication technology.  "
"2186",2018,"Ramaphosa","The drive towards the digital industrial revolution will be underpinned by the availability of efficient networks.  "
"2187",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will finalise our engagements with the telecommunications industry and other stakeholders to ensure that the allocation of spectrum reduces barriers to entry, promotes competition and reduces the cost to consumers.  "
"2188",2018,"Ramaphosa","South Africa has acceded to the Tripartite Free Trade Area agreement, which brings together SADC, COMESA and the East African Community.  "
"2189",2018,"Ramaphosa","The free trade area will combine markets of 26 countries with a population of nearly 625 million.  "
"2190",2018,"Ramaphosa","It will open market access opportunities for South African export products, contribute to job creation and the growth of South Africa’s industrial sector.  "
"2191",2018,"Ramaphosa","Negotiations towards the Continental Free Trade Agreement are progressing at a brisk pace, and it is expected that the framework agreement could be concluded soon.  "
"2192",2018,"Ramaphosa","South Africa will this year take over the chair of the BRICS group of countries, and will give priority to the promotion of value-added trade and intra-BRICS investment into productive sectors.  "
"2193",2018,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  On the 1st of May this year, we will introduce the first national minimum wage in South Africa.  "
"2194",2018,"Ramaphosa","This historic achievement – a realisation of one of the demands of the Freedom Charter – is expected to increase the earnings of more than six million working South Africans and improve the living conditions of households across the country.  "
"2195",2018,"Ramaphosa","The introduction of a national minimum wage was made possible by the determination of all social partners to reduce wage inequality while maintaining economic growth and employment creation.  "
"2196",2018,"Ramaphosa","It stands as another example of what is possible when South Africans engage in meaningful dialogue to resolve differences and confront challenges.  "
"2197",2018,"Ramaphosa","To ensure greater coherence and consistency in the implementation of economic policy – and to ensure that we are better equipped to respond to changing economic circumstances – I will be appointing a Presidential Economic Advisory Council.  "
"2198",2018,"Ramaphosa","It will draw on the expertise and capabilities that reside in labour, business, civil society and academia.  "
"2199",2018,"Ramaphosa","The country remains gripped by one of the most devastating droughts in a century, which has severely impacted our economy, social services and agricultural production.  "
"2200",2018,"Ramaphosa","The drought situation in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape has been elevated to a national state of disaster.  "
"2201",2018,"Ramaphosa","This gives national government the authority to manage and coordinate our response nationally with support from all provinces.  "
"2202",2018,"Ramaphosa","This will ensure that we also heighten integrated measures to support the provinces that are hardest hit.  "
"2203",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are looking at activating the necessary extraordinary measures permitted under the legislation.  "
"2204",2018,"Ramaphosa","I commend the people of Cape Town and the rest of the Western Cape for diligently observing water saving measures.  "
"2205",2018,"Ramaphosa","We call on everyone in the country to use water sparingly as we are a water-scarce country that relies on this vital resource to realise our development aspirations.  "
"2206",2018,"Ramaphosa","Honourable Members,  On 16 December last year, former President Jacob Zuma announced that government would be phasing in fully subsidised free higher education and training for poor and working class South Africans over a five-year period.  "
"2207",2018,"Ramaphosa","Starting this year, free higher education and training will be available to first year students from households with a gross combined annual income of up to R350,000.  "
"2208",2018,"Ramaphosa","The Minister of Higher Education and Training will lead the implementation of this policy, while the Minister of Finance will clarify all aspects of the financing of the scheme during his Budget Speech next week.  "
"2209",2018,"Ramaphosa","In addition to promoting social justice, an investment of this scale in higher education is expected to contribute to greater economic growth, reduce poverty, reduce inequality, enhance earnings and increase the competitiveness of our economy.  "
"2210",2018,"Ramaphosa","Government will continue to invest in expanding access to quality basic education and improving the outcomes of our public schools.  "
"2211",2018,"Ramaphosa","The Funza Lushaka Bursary programme plans to award 39,500 bursaries for Initial Teacher Education over the next three years.  "
"2212",2018,"Ramaphosa","In an historic first, from the beginning of this year, all public schools have begun offering an African language.  "
"2213",2018,"Ramaphosa","Also significant is the implementation of the first National Senior Certificate examination on South African Sign Language, which will be offered to deaf learners at the end of 2018.  "
"2214",2018,"Ramaphosa","The Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative programme continues to deliver modern facilities to schools in rural and underprivileged urban areas across the country, with at least 187 schools being complete to date.  "
"2215",2018,"Ramaphosa","The programme will complete all outstanding projects by the end of the next financial year.  "
"2216",2018,"Ramaphosa","Social grants remain a vital lifeline for millions of our people living in poverty.  "
"2217",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will urgently take decisive steps to comply with the all directions of the Constitutional Court.  "
"2218",2018,"Ramaphosa","I want to personally allay fears of any disruption to the efficient delivery of this critical service, and will take action to ensure no person in government is undermining implementation deadlines set by the court.  "
"2219",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will finalise work on a permanent public sector-led hybrid model, which will allow a set of public and private sector service providers to offer beneficiaries maximum choice, access and convenience.  "
"2220",2018,"Ramaphosa","This year, we will take the next critical steps to eliminate HIV from our midst.  "
"2221",2018,"Ramaphosa","By scaling up our testing and treating campaign, we will initiate an additional two million people on antiretroviral treatment by December 2020.  "
"2222",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will also need to confront lifestyles diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases.  "
"2223",2018,"Ramaphosa","In the next three months we will launch a huge cancer campaign similar to the HIV counselling and testing campaign.  "
"2224",2018,"Ramaphosa","This will also involve the private sector as we need to mobilise all resources to fight this disease.  "
"2225",2018,"Ramaphosa","The time has now arrived to finally implement universal health coverage through the National Health Insurance.  "
"2226",2018,"Ramaphosa","The NHI Bill is now ready to be processed through government and will be submitted to Parliament in the next few weeks.  "
"2227",2018,"Ramaphosa","Certain NHI projects targeting the most vulnerable people in society will commence in April this year.  "
"2228",2018,"Ramaphosa","In improving the quality of life of all South Africans, we must intensify our efforts to tackle crime and build safer communities.  "
"2229",2018,"Ramaphosa","During the course of this year, the Community Policing Strategy will be implemented, with the aim of gaining the trust of the community and to secure their full involvement in the fight against crime.  "
"2230",2018,"Ramaphosa","The introduction of a Youth Crime Prevention Strategy will empower and support young people to be self-sufficient and become involved in crime fighting initiatives.  "
"2231",2018,"Ramaphosa","A key focus this year will be the distribution of resources to police station level.  "
"2232",2018,"Ramaphosa","This will include personnel and other resources, to restore capacity and experience at the level at which crime is most effectively combated.  "
"2233",2018,"Ramaphosa","In recognising the critical role that NGOs and community-based organisation play in tackling poverty, inequality and related social problems, we will convene a Social Sector Summit during the course of this year.  "
"2234",2018,"Ramaphosa","Among other things, this Summit should seek to improve the interface between the state and civil society and address the challenges that NGOs and CBOs face.  "
"2235",2018,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Growth, development and transformation depend on a strong and capable state.  "
"2236",2018,"Ramaphosa","It is critical that the structure and size of the state is optimally suited to meet the needs of the people and ensure the most efficient allocation of public resources.  "
"2237",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will therefore initiate a process to review the configuration, number and size of national government departments.  "
"2238",2018,"Ramaphosa","Many of our state owned enterprises are experiencing severe financial, operation and governance challenges, which has impacted on the performance of the economy and placed pressure on the fiscus.  "
"2239",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will intervene decisively to stabilise and revitalise state owned enterprises.  "
"2240",2018,"Ramaphosa","The recent action we have taken at Eskom to strengthen governance, root out corruption and restore its financial position is just the beginning.  "
"2241",2018,"Ramaphosa","Government will take further measures to ensure that all state owned companies fulfil their economic and developmental mandates.  "
"2242",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will need to confront the reality that the challenges at some of our SOEs are structural – that they do not have a sufficient revenue stream to fund their operational costs.  "
"2243",2018,"Ramaphosa","These SOEs cannot borrow their way out of their financial difficulties, and we will therefore undertake a process of consultation with all stakeholders to review the funding model of SOEs and other measures.  "
"2244",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will change the way that boards are appointed so that only people with expertise, experience and integrity serve in these vital positions.  "
"2245",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will remove board members from any role in procurement and work with the Auditor-General to strengthen external audit processes.  "
"2246",2018,"Ramaphosa","As we address challenges in specific companies, work will continue on the broad architecture of the state owned enterprises sector to achieve better coordination, oversight and sustainability.  "
"2247",2018,"Ramaphosa","This is the year in which we will turn the tide of corruption in our public institutions.  "
"2248",2018,"Ramaphosa","The criminal justice institutions have been taking initiatives that will enable us to deal effectively with corruption.  "
"2249",2018,"Ramaphosa","The commission of inquiry into state capture headed by the Deputy Chief Justice, Judge Raymond Zondo, is expected to commence its work shortly.  "
"2250",2018,"Ramaphosa","The Commission is critical to ensuring that the extent and nature of state capture is established, that confidence in public institutions is restored and that those responsible for any wrongdoing are identified.  "
"2251",2018,"Ramaphosa","The Commission should not displace the regular work of the country’s law enforcement agencies in investigating and prosecuting any and all acts of corruption.  "
"2252",2018,"Ramaphosa","Amasela aba imali ka Rhilumente mawabanjwe.  "
"2253",2018,"Ramaphosa","We must fight corruption, fraud and collusion in the private sector with the same purpose and intensity.  "
"2254",2018,"Ramaphosa","We must remember that every time someone receives a bribe there is someone who is prepared to pay it.  "
"2255",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will make sure that we deal with both in an effective manner.  "
"2256",2018,"Ramaphosa","We urge professional bodies and regulatory authorities to take action against members who are found to have acted improperly and unethically.  "
"2257",2018,"Ramaphosa","This requires that we strengthen law enforcement institutions and that we shield them from external interference or manipulation.  "
"2258",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will urgently attend to the leadership issues at the National Prosecuting Authority to ensure that this critical institution is stabilised and able to perform its mandate unhindered.  "
"2259",2018,"Ramaphosa","We will also take steps to stabilise and strengthen vital institutions like the South African Revenue Service.  "
"2260",2018,"Ramaphosa","We must understand that tax morality is dependent on an implicit contract between taxpayers and government that state spending provides value for money and is free from corruption.  "
"2261",2018,"Ramaphosa","At the request of the Minister of Finance, I will shortly appoint a Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance of SARS, to ensure that we restore the credibility of the Service and strengthen its capacity to meet its revenue targets.  "
"2262",2018,"Ramaphosa","Our state employs one million public servants.  "
"2263",2018,"Ramaphosa","The majority of them serve our people with diligence and commitment.  "
"2264",2018,"Ramaphosa","We applaud them for the excellent work they do.  "
"2265",2018,"Ramaphosa","However, we know the challenges that our people face when they interact with the state.  "
"2266",2018,"Ramaphosa","In too many cases, they often get poor service or no service at all.  "
"2267",2018,"Ramaphosa","We want our public servants to adhere to the principle of Batho Pele, of putting our people first.  "
"2268",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are determined that everyone in public service should undertake their responsibilities with efficiency, diligence and integrity.  "
"2269",2018,"Ramaphosa","We want to instil a new discipline, to do things correctly, to do them completely and to do them timeously.  "
"2270",2018,"Ramaphosa","We call on all public servants to become agents for change.  "
"2271",2018,"Ramaphosa","During the course of the next few months, I will visit every national department to engage with the senior leadership to ensure that the work of government is effectively aligned.  "
"2272",2018,"Ramaphosa","I will also find time to meet with provincial and local government leaders to ensure that the state, in its entirety, responds to the pressing needs of our people.  "
"2273",2018,"Ramaphosa","Fellow South Africans,  Our country has entered a period of change.  "
"2274",2018,"Ramaphosa","While change can produce uncertainty, even anxiety, it also offers great opportunities for renewal and revitalisation, and for progress.  "
"2275",2018,"Ramaphosa","Together we are going to make history.  "
"2276",2018,"Ramaphosa","We have done it before and we will do it again – bonded by our common love for our country, resolute in our determination to overcome the challenges that lie ahead and convinced that by working together we will build the fair and just and decent society to which Nelson Mandela dedicated his life.  "
"2277",2018,"Ramaphosa","As I conclude, allow me to recall the words of the late great Bra Hugh Masekela.  "
"2278",2018,"Ramaphosa","In his song, ‘Thuma Mina’, he anticipated a day of renewal, of new beginnings.  "
"2279",2018,"Ramaphosa","He sang:  “I wanna be there when the people start to turn it around  When they triumph over poverty  I wanna be there when the people win the battle against AIDS  I wanna lend a hand  I wanna be there for the alcoholic  I wanna be there for the drug addict  I wanna be there for the victims of violence and abuse  I wanna lend a hand  Send me.”  "
"2280",2018,"Ramaphosa","We are at a moment in the history of our nation when the people, through their determination, have started to turn the country around.  "
"2281",2018,"Ramaphosa","We can envisage the triumph over poverty, we can see the end of the battle against AIDS.  "
"2282",2018,"Ramaphosa","Now is the time to lend a hand.  "
"2283",2018,"Ramaphosa","Now is the time for each of us to say ‘send me’.  "
"2284",2018,"Ramaphosa","Now is the time for all of us to work together, in honour of Nelson Mandela, to build a new, better South Africa for all.  "
"2285",2018,"Ramaphosa","I thank you."
"2286",2017,"Zuma"," The Speaker of the National Assembly,  The Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces;  Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa,  Former President Thabo Mbeki, Chief Justice Mogoeng and all esteemed members of the judiciary,  Ministers and Deputy Ministers,  Premiers and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures, Chairperson of SALGA,  The Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions, Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders,  The President of the Muslim Judicial Council and all Leaders of faith based organisations,  The former Speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Frene Ginwala,  Veterans of the struggle for liberation,  Members of the diplomatic corps,  Fellow South Africans,  Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, goeie naand, lotshani, riperile, ndimadekwana,  Thank you Madam Speaker and Madam Chairperson for this opportunity to address the joint sitting of Parliament.  "
"2287",2017,"Zuma","An illustrious son of our country, President Oliver Reginald Tambo, would have turned 100 years old this year, had he lived.  "
"2288",2017,"Zuma","This selfless patriot his adult life to a tireless pursuit of the liberation of our country and its people. "
"2289",2017,"Zuma","He left a lasting legacy for all South Africans, and not only for his organisation, the ANC.  "
"2290",2017,"Zuma","In his honour, we have declared the year 2017, the Year of Oliver Reginald Tambo. "
"2291",2017,"Zuma","It is the year of unity in action by all South Africans as we move South Africa forward together.  "
"2292",2017,"Zuma","We have the pleasure to host members of the Tambo family this evening, Mr Dali Tambo with his wife Rachel, and their son Oliver Tambo Junior.  "
"2293",2017,"Zuma","We also fondly remember Mama Africa, Miriam Makeba, who made history when she addressed the United Nations in 1963, appealing for action against the apartheid regime.  "
"2294",2017,"Zuma","We extend a warm welcome to her grand-daughter Zenzile Makeba Lee and great-grandson Lindelani.  "
"2295",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  In this 23rd year of our freedom, our mission remains the quest for a united, democratic, non-sexist, non-racial and prosperous South Africa.  "
"2296",2017,"Zuma","Guided by the National Development Plan, we are building a South Africa that must be free from poverty, inequality and unemployment.   "
"2297",2017,"Zuma","While the global economic environment remains uncertain, indications are that we have entered a period of recovery. "
"2298",2017,"Zuma","We anticipate an economic growth rate of 1.3 per cent in 2017 following an estimated 0.5 per cent in 2016.  "
"2299",2017,"Zuma","However, the economy is still not growing fast enough to create the jobs we need. "
"2300",2017,"Zuma","There are some of our people, including youth, who have not worked for years.    "
"2301",2017,"Zuma","It is for this reason that we decided to focus on a few key areas packaged as the Nine Point Plan to reignite growth so that the economy can create much-needed jobs.   "
"2302",2017,"Zuma","The focus areas include industrialisation, mining and beneficiation, Agriculture and agro Processing, energy, SMMEs, managing work place conflict, attracting investments, growing the oceans economy and tourism.  "
"2303",2017,"Zuma","We also added cross-cutting areas such as science and technology; Water and sanitation Infrastructure; Transport Infrastructure; and Broadband Rollout.  "
"2304",2017,"Zuma","I would like to provide a report back on the work done in some of these areas in the past year.  "
"2305",2017,"Zuma","The interaction that we started last year between government, business and labour, known as the CEO Initiative, has been most helpful. "
"2306",2017,"Zuma","We were able to address some domestic challenges together.  "
"2307",2017,"Zuma","We successfully avoided credit ratings downgrades which would have had significant impact on our economy.  "
"2308",2017,"Zuma","Our labour market environment is also showing signs of stability, due to cooperation by social partners. "
"2309",2017,"Zuma","The manner in which parties conducted and carried themselves during the wage negotiations in the platinum sector in particular, must be applauded.  "
"2310",2017,"Zuma","Unity in action was also demonstrated again this week with the conclusion of the agreement on the National Minimum Wage and on measures to stabilise labour relations.  "
"2311",2017,"Zuma","This follows a call I had made in the State of the Nation Address on 14 June 2014.  "
"2312",2017,"Zuma","We congratulate the Deputy President and the team at NEDLAC for this milestone and wish them well for work that still needs to be done.  "
"2313",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  The extension of basic services to the people continued in the past year as we pursued a better life for all. "
"2314",2017,"Zuma","To date nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have electricity.  "
"2315",2017,"Zuma","The successful execution of the Eskom’s build and maintenance programmes helped ensure stability and an end to load-shedding.  "
"2316",2017,"Zuma","Work is continuing to ensure energy security. "
"2317",2017,"Zuma","Renewable energy forms an important part of our energy mix, which also includes electricity generation from gas, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro and coal.  "
"2318",2017,"Zuma","Government is committed to the overall Independent Power Producers Programme and we are expanding the programme to other sources of energy including coal and gas, in addition to renewable energy.  "
"2319",2017,"Zuma","Eskom will sign the outstanding power purchase agreements for renewable energy in line with the procured rounds.  "
"2320",2017,"Zuma","Government is working hard to ensure reliable bulk water supply in the various areas of the country to support economic growth whilst increasing access to vulnerable and rural municipalities.  "
"2321",2017,"Zuma","In an effort to curb the high water losses which in some municipalities far exceeds the national average which is currently at 37%; about ten thousand unemployed youth are being trained as plumbers, artisans and water agents. "
"2322",2017,"Zuma","More will be recruited this year to reach the total of fifteen thousand.  "
"2323",2017,"Zuma","We call upon municipalities to support the War on Leaks programme.  "
"2324",2017,"Zuma","We continue to build modern schools replacing mud structures and other inappropriate buildings through the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure delivery Initiative, (ASIDI). "
"2325",2017,"Zuma","This gives our children dignity.  "
"2326",2017,"Zuma","A total of one hundred and seventy three inappropriate structures have been eradicated since 2011. "
"2327",2017,"Zuma","In total, 895 new schools now provide a conducive learning environment for our children.  "
"2328",2017,"Zuma","On Investment promotion, Government has established InvestSA, an investment One Stop Shop nationally and will open provincial centres in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Western Cape.  "
"2329",2017,"Zuma","The message is clear to the affected government departments. "
"2330",2017,"Zuma","There must be no undue delays and no unnecessary red tape. "
"2331",2017,"Zuma","From issuing licences to visas, we should make it easy to do business in South Africa.  "
"2332",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots  President OR Tambo was a maths and science teacher. "
"2333",2017,"Zuma","Government will thus prioritise maths and science more than ever before this year, in his memory.  "
"2334",2017,"Zuma","We are encouraged by recent international test results.  "
"2335",2017,"Zuma","The results in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Southern and East African Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality show that the performance of South African learners is improving.  "
"2336",2017,"Zuma","Amongst the participating countries, South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in Mathematics and 90 points in Science.  "
"2337",2017,"Zuma","This is very encouraging as we don’t want our children to be left behind.  "
"2338",2017,"Zuma","Our investment in science and technology is yielding results.  "
"2339",2017,"Zuma","Since South Africa, supported by its eight African partners, won the bid to host the Square Kilometre Array telescope, significant progress has been made in building this mega science project and reaping its benefits.   "
"2340",2017,"Zuma","Together with its precursor, the MeerKAT telescope, the SKA project continues to make important contributions to socio-economic development in South Africa.   "
"2341",2017,"Zuma","Working closely with the industry, the Department of Science and Technology is implementing a technology localization strategy. "
"2342",2017,"Zuma","This has ensured that the two billion rand MeerKAT telescope is constructed with seventy five percent local content.  "
"2343",2017,"Zuma","This has led to job creation in the Northern Cape and diversification of the economy through the creation of artisan and maintenance jobs, and the promotion of science as a career of choice.  "
"2344",2017,"Zuma","On road infrastructure, Sanral has started with the planning phase of the 4.5 billion rand project to upgrade the current Moloto road.  "
"2345",2017,"Zuma","Sakha umgwaqo kanye nololiwe ku Moloto Road ukuze kuphephe izimpilo zabantu ngoba izingozi sezithathe imiphefumulo eminingi kuleyandawo.  "
"2346",2017,"Zuma","During 2016, South Africa also signed a co-operation agreement with the People’s Republic of China to build the Moloto Rail Development Corridor.  "
"2347",2017,"Zuma","In 2014 we launched the operation Phakisa Big Fast results methodology in the ocean economy, health, education and mining sectors. "
"2348",2017,"Zuma","The purpose was to find a few key projects where we could unlock growth in implementing the NDP.  "
"2349",2017,"Zuma","All projects are proceeding well.  "
"2350",2017,"Zuma","The South African Navy also participates in the Phakisa project and is preparing to host the government garage concept for all state-owned vessels in Simon’s Town, including the maintenance and repair of government-owned vessels, through the newly established South African Navy/ARMSCOR/Denel partnership.  "
"2351",2017,"Zuma","We had identified tourism as a key job driver. "
"2352",2017,"Zuma","We are thus pleased that our tourist arrival numbers for the period January to November 2016 increased to nine million, an increase of just over one million arrivals from 2015. "
"2353",2017,"Zuma","This represents a thirteen percent growth in tourist arrivals.    "
"2354",2017,"Zuma","Government runs effective poverty alleviation programmes such as the Expanded Public Works Programme. "
"2355",2017,"Zuma","In addition, social grants now reach close to 17 million people, mainly older persons and children. "
"2356",2017,"Zuma","Many families would not be able to put food on the table if it were not for social grants.  "
"2357",2017,"Zuma","The Expanded Public Works Programme has since 2014, created more than two million work opportunities towards the attainment of the target of six million work opportunities by the end of March 2019. "
"2358",2017,"Zuma","Of the work opportunities created, more than one million have been taken up by the youth.  "
"2359",2017,"Zuma","During 2015/2016, more than sixty one thousand work opportunities were created through the Environmental Programmes such as Working for Water, Working for Wetlands, Working on Fire and Working for Ecosystems. "
"2360",2017,"Zuma","More than 60% of the beneficiaries were young people.  "
"2361",2017,"Zuma","Government working with society is fighting social ills that are tearing communities apart such as drugs and substance abuse. "
"2362",2017,"Zuma","From Soshanguve to Rosettenville or KwaMashu to the Cape Flats, communities are in difficulty because of the drugs.  "
"2363",2017,"Zuma","Other than law enforcement, the provision of treatment and prevention services is also critical.  "
"2364",2017,"Zuma","The Department of Social Development is building new public treatment centres in provinces where there are no such facilities, in the Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, Free State and the Eastern Cape.  "
"2365",2017,"Zuma","Working together we will save our youth from drugs.  "
"2366",2017,"Zuma","On health matters, the National Health Insurance is our flagship project that is aimed at moving South Africa towards Universal Health Coverage.  "
"2367",2017,"Zuma","The NHI will be implemented in a 14 year period in three phases.  "
"2368",2017,"Zuma","We are in the midst of the first phase which is the preparatory phase, which started in 2012.  "
"2369",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots  We are deeply distressed by the death of so many psychiatric patients in Gauteng.  "
"2370",2017,"Zuma","Mentally ill patients are some of the most vulnerable members of society, who need protection from the state itself and society as a whole. "
"2371",2017,"Zuma","I have instructed the Minister of Health to ensure that the Health Ombudsperson’s recommendations are wholly and speedily implemented without any reservations.  "
"2372",2017,"Zuma","We welcome the recommendation of the Health Ombudsperson that there is an urgent need to review the National Health Act 2003 and the Mental Health Act 2002 with a view that certain powers and functions revert back to the National Minister of Health.  "
"2373",2017,"Zuma","Once more, we extend our heartfelt condolences to all families and relatives of the deceased.  "
"2374",2017,"Zuma","Government will provide support so that families do not face this burden alone. "
"2375",2017,"Zuma","The Premier of Gauteng and the Minister of Health have already provided this assurance.  "
"2376",2017,"Zuma","A lot more work has been done in the past year in implementing the Nine Point Plan and all our programmes. "
"2377",2017,"Zuma","Ministers will report further on the programmes during the budget votes.  "
"2378",2017,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  I would now like to speak on our priorities for the year ahead.  "
"2379",2017,"Zuma","Political freedom alone is incomplete without economic emancipation.  "
"2380",2017,"Zuma","Oliver Tambo spoke clearly about this mission at an SACP anniversary meeting in London in 1981.  "
"2381",2017,"Zuma","He said:  “The objective of our struggle in South Africa, as set out in the Freedom Charter, encompasses economic emancipation. "
"2382",2017,"Zuma","It is inconceivable for liberation to have meaning without a return of the wealth of the country to the people as a whole.  "
"2383",2017,"Zuma","“To allow the existing economic forces to retain their interests intact is to feed the roots of racial supremacy and exploitation, and does not represent even the shadow of liberation.  "
"2384",2017,"Zuma","“It is therefore a fundamental feature of our strategy that victory must embrace more than formal political democracy; and our drive towards national emancipation must include economic emancipation.”  "
"2385",2017,"Zuma","What do we mean by radical socio-economic transformation?  "
"2386",2017,"Zuma","We mean fundamental change in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor, the majority of whom are African and female, as defined by the governing party which makes policy for the democratic government.  "
"2387",2017,"Zuma","Twenty two years into our freedom and democracy, the majority of black people are still economically disempowered. "
"2388",2017,"Zuma","They are dissatisfied with the economic gains from liberation.  "
"2389",2017,"Zuma","The gap between the annual average household incomes of African-headed households and their white counterparts remains shockingly huge.  "
"2390",2017,"Zuma","White households earn at least five times more than black households, according to Statistics SA.  "
"2391",2017,"Zuma","The situation with regards to the ownership of the economy also mirrors that of household incomes.  "
"2392",2017,"Zuma","Only ten percent of the top one hundred companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are owned by black South Africans, directly-achieved principally, through the black empowerment codes, according to the National Empowerment Fund.  "
"2393",2017,"Zuma","The pace of transformation in the workplace, the implementation of affirmative action policies as required by the Employment Equity Act, also remains very slow.  "
"2394",2017,"Zuma","In terms of the 2015/16 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management level amounted to 72 percent whilst African representation was at 10 percent.  "
"2395",2017,"Zuma","The representation of Coloureds stood at 4.5% and Indians 8.7%.  "
"2396",2017,"Zuma","The report further provides that white South Africans, in particular males, are afforded higher levels of recruitment, promotion and training opportunities as compared, to the designated groups.  "
"2397",2017,"Zuma","At the level of gender at senior management level, males remain dominant at 67.6% and females at 32.4% percent.  "
"2398",2017,"Zuma","The skewed nature of ownership and leadership patterns needs to be corrected. "
"2399",2017,"Zuma","There can be no sustainability in any economy if the majority is excluded in this manner. "
"2400",2017,"Zuma","In my discussions with the business community, they accepted these transformation imperatives.  "
"2401",2017,"Zuma","Today we are starting a new chapter of radical socio-economic transformation. "
"2402",2017,"Zuma","We are saying that we should move beyond words, to practical programmes.  "
"2403",2017,"Zuma","The state will play a role in the economy to drive that transformation. "
"2404",2017,"Zuma","In this regard, Government will utilise to the maximum, the strategic levers that are available to the state.  "
"2405",2017,"Zuma","This includes legislation, regulations, licensing, budget and procurement as well as Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Charters to influence the behaviour of the private sector and drive transformation.  "
"2406",2017,"Zuma","The State spends five hundred billion rand a year buying goods and services. "
"2407",2017,"Zuma","Added to this is the nine hundred billion rand infrastructure budget. "
"2408",2017,"Zuma","Those budgets must be used to achieve economic transformation.  "
"2409",2017,"Zuma","As a start, the new regulations making it compulsory for big contractors to subcontract 30 percent of business to black owned enterprises have been finalised and were gazetted on the 20th of January.  "
"2410",2017,"Zuma","Through such regulations and programmes, government will be able to use the state buying power to empower small enterprises, rural and township enterprises, designated groups and to promote local industrial development.  "
"2411",2017,"Zuma","Two key challenges we face is the high levels of concentration in the economy as well as the collusion and cartels, which squeeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists.  "
"2412",2017,"Zuma","The competition authorities have done excellent work to uncover the cartels and punish them for breaking the law.  "
"2413",2017,"Zuma","Last year I signed into law a provision to criminalize the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on 1 May. "
"2414",2017,"Zuma","It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years.  "
"2415",2017,"Zuma","We are now stepping up our actions to deal with the other challenge, namely economic concentration, where a small grouping controls most of a market.  "
"2416",2017,"Zuma","During this year, the Department of Economic Development will bring legislation to Cabinet that will seek to amend the Competition Act. "
"2417",2017,"Zuma","It will among others address the need to have a more inclusive economy and to de-concentrate the high levels of ownership and control we see in many sectors. "
"2418",2017,"Zuma","We will then table the legislation for consideration by parliament.  "
"2419",2017,"Zuma","In this way, we seek to open up the economy to new players, give black South Africans opportunities in the economy and indeed help to make the economy more dynamic, competitive and inclusive. "
"2420",2017,"Zuma","This is our vision of radical economic transformation.  "
"2421",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Government is actively involved in the property sector, having provided more than four million houses since 1994.  "
"2422",2017,"Zuma","This sector in our country is valued at approximately seven trillion rand, with the subsidised sector being valued at one point five trillion rand.  "
"2423",2017,"Zuma","However, less than five percent of the sector is owned or managed by Black people and Africans in particular. "
"2424",2017,"Zuma","A draft Property Practitioners Bill will be published by the Department of Human Settlements for public comment with the purpose of establishing a more inclusive, representative sector, towards radical economic transformation.  "
"2425",2017,"Zuma","Among key priorities this year, Government will also address the increasing delays and backlogs in registration and issuing of title deeds to beneficiaries of housing projects funded by the capital subsidy.  "
"2426",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  We reiterate that radical economic transformation should mean moving beyond share ownership schemes only.  "
"2427",2017,"Zuma","We would like to see black people involved directly in business, owning factories. "
"2428",2017,"Zuma","The development of the Black Industrialists programme is thus critical.   "
"2429",2017,"Zuma","The programme has from inception supported more than 22 entrepreneurs.  "
"2430",2017,"Zuma","Government has further opportunities in the property maintenance projects of the Department of Public Works.  "
"2431",2017,"Zuma","The Department will invest approximately one hundred million rand this year on critical capital and maintenance programmes to modernise harbours. "
"2432",2017,"Zuma","They will also continue generating revenue from letting state owned harbours and coastline properties, which will benefit black owned SMMEs.  "
"2433",2017,"Zuma","Government will also continue to pursue policies that seek to broaden the participation of black people and SMMEs, including those owned by women and the youth, in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector.  "
"2434",2017,"Zuma","We assure the youth that the lowering of the cost of data is uppermost in our policies and plans.  "
"2435",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Mining has always been the backbone of our economy and an important foreign exchange earner.  "
"2436",2017,"Zuma","We welcome the recovery in commodity prices which has resulted in an upswing in mining output. "
"2437",2017,"Zuma","This augurs well for the industry.  "
"2438",2017,"Zuma","The Mining Charter is currently being reviewed. "
"2439",2017,"Zuma","The Charter seeks to recognise the internationally accepted right of the state to exercise sovereignty over all the mineral and petroleum resources within the Republic.  "
"2440",2017,"Zuma","It is also aimed at helping the country to de-racialise the ownership of the mining industry. "
"2441",2017,"Zuma","This will help ensure the sustainability of this industry.  "
"2442",2017,"Zuma","We trust that discussions between government and business on the Charter will yield results so that the process can be finalised.  "
"2443",2017,"Zuma","We will continue to pursue direct state involvement in mining. "
"2444",2017,"Zuma","The Mining Company of South Africa Bill will be presented to Cabinet and Parliament during the year.  "
"2445",2017,"Zuma","The Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment Bill was sent back to Parliament so that issues relating to the public consultation process undertaken by Provincial legislatures can be addressed.  "
"2446",2017,"Zuma","We trust that it shall be processed and returned for finalization without much delay so that the concerns relating to uncertainty raised by business can be resolved.  "
"2447",2017,"Zuma","Government continues to work with other stakeholders to combat illegal mining to save lives and to prevent the trafficking of precious metals and diamonds.  "
"2448",2017,"Zuma","We also continue to place great emphasis on the health and safety of mineworkers which is so crucial to the sustainability of the mining sector. "
"2449",2017,"Zuma","Working with the mining companies we can ensure that lives are protected at all times.  "
"2450",2017,"Zuma","The tragic accident that occurred at Lily Mine outside in Mpumalanga earlier in 2015 is the first of its kind that we have experienced since the dawn of democracy.  "
"2451",2017,"Zuma","The families are going through immense pain and frustration.  "
"2452",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  It will be difficult if not impossible, to achieve true reconciliation until the land question is resolved.  "
"2453",2017,"Zuma","Only eight million hectares of arable land have been transferred to black people, which is only 9.8 percent of the 82 million hectares of arable land in South Africa.  "
"2454",2017,"Zuma","There has also been a 19 percent decline in households involved in agriculture from 2,9million in 2011 to 2,3 million households in 2016.  "
"2455",2017,"Zuma","We had stated our intention of using the Expropriation Act to pursue land reform and land redistribution, in line with the Constitution.  "
"2456",2017,"Zuma","I have now decided to refer the Bill back to Parliament for reconsideration on the basis that the Bill might not pass constitutional master. "
"2457",2017,"Zuma","This is due to inadequate public participation during its processing.  "
"2458",2017,"Zuma","We trust that Parliament will be able to move with speed in meeting the requirements so that the law can be finalised to effect transformation.  "
"2459",2017,"Zuma","The reopening of land claims is also still on hold because the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, 2014 was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court.  "
"2460",2017,"Zuma","The Constitutional Court found that the public consultation process facilitated by the National Council of Provinces and some Provincial Legislatures, did not meet the standard set in the Constitution.  "
"2461",2017,"Zuma","Going forward, government will continue to implement other programmes such as the Strengthening of Relatives Rights programme, also known as the 50-50 programme.  "
"2462",2017,"Zuma","In this programme, the farm workers join together into a legal entity and together with the farm owner a new company is established and the workers and the owner become joint owners.  "
"2463",2017,"Zuma","To date 13 proposals have already been approved benefiting 921 farm dweller households at a value of R631 million. "
"2464",2017,"Zuma","We applaud farmers and farm workers for this innovation.  "
"2465",2017,"Zuma","Most importantly, we appeal to land claimants to accept land instead of financial compensation. "
"2466",2017,"Zuma","Over 90% of claims are currently settled through financial compensation which does not help the process at all. "
"2467",2017,"Zuma","It perpetuates dispossession. "
"2468",2017,"Zuma","It also undermines economic empowerment.  "
"2469",2017,"Zuma","Government has committed itself to support black smallholder farmers.  "
"2470",2017,"Zuma","I received a memorandum from the African Farmers Association of South Africa who say the year 2017 must be the year of the commercialisation of the black small holder farmers.  "
"2471",2017,"Zuma","Indeed, Government will implement a commercialisation support programme for 450 black smallholder farmers.  "
"2472",2017,"Zuma","We encourage more women to consider farming. "
"2473",2017,"Zuma","I have as a special guest today, the 2016 Female Farmer of the Year, Ms Vanecia Janse from Koukamma municipality in the Eastern Cape.  "
"2474",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Our farmers went through a difficult period last year because of the drought.  "
"2475",2017,"Zuma","To date, an estimated amount of 2.5 billion rand was made available for the provision of livestock feed, water infrastructure, drilling, equipping and refurbishment of boreholes, auction sales and other interventions.  "
"2476",2017,"Zuma","Furthermore, the Industrial Development Corporation and the Land Bank availed funding of about five hundred million rand to distressed farmers to manage their credit facilities and support with soft loans.  "
"2477",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  President OR Tambo was a champion of women’s rights.  "
"2478",2017,"Zuma","We will continue to mainstream the empowerment of women in all government programmes.  "
"2479",2017,"Zuma","Government will continue to prioritise women’s access to economic opportunities and, in particular, to business financing and credit.  "
"2480",2017,"Zuma","This is the freedom that heroines of the struggle such as the late Dora Tamana of Gugulethu here in Cape Town fought for. "
"2481",2017,"Zuma","I am pleased to have her son Mongezi Tamana as a guest today.  "
"2482",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  In December 2015 university students voiced their concerns about the cost of higher education.  "
"2483",2017,"Zuma","They correctly pointed out that accumulated debt and fast rising fees were making it harder and harder for those who come from less-privileged households to enter and stay within the education system until they complete their studies.  "
"2484",2017,"Zuma","It is for this reason that when university students expressed genuine concerns about  being excluded from universities, our caring government responded appropriately by taking over the responsibility to pay the fee increase for the 2016 academic year.  "
"2485",2017,"Zuma","Government also settled all debt owed by NSFAS students and extended the coverage to larger numbers of students than ever before.  "
"2486",2017,"Zuma","At the time of tabling the 2016 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, our government announced additional measures aimed at making higher education accessible to more students from working class families.  "
"2487",2017,"Zuma","Government has provided funds to ensure that no student whose combined family income is up to six hundred thousand rand per annum will face fee increases at universities and TVET colleges for 2017.  "
"2488",2017,"Zuma","All students who qualify for NSFAS and who have been accepted by universities and TVET colleges will be funded.  "
"2489",2017,"Zuma","The university debt of NSFAS qualifying students for 2013, 2014 and 2015 academic years has been addressed. "
"2490",2017,"Zuma","In total, government has reprioritised thirty two billion rand within government baselines to support higher education.  "
"2491",2017,"Zuma","We are ensuring that our deserving students can study without fearing that past debts will prevent them from finishing their studies.  "
"2492",2017,"Zuma","In the remaining years of this administration, our policies will respond directly to the following concerns that the students have placed firmly on the table:  Firstly, the students have expressed concern that the NSFAS threshold of one hundred and twenty two thousand rand is too low. "
"2493",2017,"Zuma","We will have to look into this matter with the view to raising the threshold on a phased basis in the period ahead.  "
"2494",2017,"Zuma","Secondly, the students have pointed out that the full cost of study at some universities is higher than the subsidy that NSFAS provides.  "
"2495",2017,"Zuma","As a result, NSFAS students who study at some universities that charge higher fees end up accumulating debt. "
"2496",2017,"Zuma","Our government-initiated processes are already looking at this issue too.  "
"2497",2017,"Zuma","Honourable Members and Fellow South Africans, students and their parents should understand that the needs for services like water, sanitation, early childhood development and good public transport have to also be addressed, alongside access to quality higher education and training.  "
"2498",2017,"Zuma","But our commitment to finding sustainable solutions to the funding of the social wage in general, and education, in particular, is unwavering.  "
"2499",2017,"Zuma","As the processes that we have set in motion draw to a close, such as the Heher Commission, the Ministerial Task Team, broader engagements with students, university and TVETS leadership and civil society, we will find resources to give expression to our policies.  "
"2500",2017,"Zuma","I invite all stakeholders to participate in the processes that are under way so that no view is not heard.  "
"2501",2017,"Zuma","No great idea should be excluded. "
"2502",2017,"Zuma","As soon as the broadest sections of our society agree on what to do, our government will take steps to reprioritise resources to implement it on a phased basis.  "
"2503",2017,"Zuma","Let us engage to identify the most pressing needs, and allocate our limited resources accordingly. "
"2504",2017,"Zuma","Let us build our self-reliance and move forward in the spirit of unity.  "
"2505",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots,  The fight against crime is an apex priority. "
"2506",2017,"Zuma","The police will increase visible policing, building on the successful pattern of deployments utilised during the Safer Festive Season Campaign.  "
"2507",2017,"Zuma","They will also utilise certain specialized capabilities, such as the Tactical Response Teams and National Intervention Units, to assist in addressing problematic high-crime areas.  "
"2508",2017,"Zuma","We received a message from Soshanguve last week that crime is rife in Block L and that hijackings and robberies are high. "
"2509",2017,"Zuma","It is such communities that need to build stronger partnerships with the police to ensure that criminals do not prey on residents.  "
"2510",2017,"Zuma","Other measures to fight crime nationally will include the establishment of Specialised Units, focusing on drug-related crime, taxi violence and firearms and the enhanced utilisation of investigative aids such as forensic leads.  "
"2511",2017,"Zuma","The Police will also enhance the utilisation of the DNA Database in the identification of suspects.  "
"2512",2017,"Zuma","We urge the public to work with the police to ensure safer communities.  "
"2513",2017,"Zuma","Compatriots  We welcome the decline in Rhino poaching incidents since October 2015 which is for the first time in a decade. "

"2603",2016,"Zuma","When the economy grows fast it delivers jobs. "
"2604",2016,"Zuma","Workers earn wages and businesses make profits.  "
"2605",2016,"Zuma","The tax base expands and allows government to increase the social wage and provide education, health, social grants, housing and free basic services ¬– faster and in a more sustainable manner.  "
"2606",2016,"Zuma","Our economy has been facing difficulties since the financial crisis in 2008. "
"2607",2016,"Zuma","We embarked on an aggressive infrastructure development programme to stimulate growth.  "
"2608",2016,"Zuma","Our reality right now is that global growth still remains muted. "
"2609",2016,"Zuma","Financial markets have become volatile. "
"2610",2016,"Zuma","Currencies of emerging markets have become weak and they fluctuate widely.  "
"2611",2016,"Zuma","The prices of gold, platinum, coal and other minerals that we sell to the rest of the world have dropped significantly and continue to be low.  "
"2612",2016,"Zuma","The economies of two of our partners in BRICS, Brazil and Russia,  are expected to contract this year. "
"2613",2016,"Zuma","The third, China, will not register the kind of robust growth that it is known for.  "
"2614",2016,"Zuma","Because our economy is relatively small and open, it is affected by all of these developments. "
"2615",2016,"Zuma","Our economy is also affected by domestic factors such as the electricity constraints and industrial relations which are sometimes unstable.  "
"2616",2016,"Zuma","The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank predict that the South African economy will grow by less than 1% this year. "
"2617",2016,"Zuma","The lower economic growth outcomes and outlook suggest that revenue collection will be lower than previously expected.  "
"2618",2016,"Zuma","Importantly, our country seems to be at risk of losing its investment grade status from ratings agencies. "
"2619",2016,"Zuma","If that happens, it will become more expensive for us to borrow money from abroad to finance our programmes of building a better life for all, especially the poor.  "
"2620",2016,"Zuma","The situation requires an effective turnaround plan from us. "
"2621",2016,"Zuma","It is about doing things differently and also acting on what may not have been acted upon quickly before.  "
"2622",2016,"Zuma","I will share a few points that we believe would make a difference.  "
"2623",2016,"Zuma","First, our country remains an attractive investment destination. "
"2624",2016,"Zuma","It may face challenges, but its positive attributes far outweigh those challenges.  "
"2625",2016,"Zuma","We must continue to market the country as a preferred destination for investments. "
"2626",2016,"Zuma","This requires a common narrative from all of us as business, labour and government.  "
"2627",2016,"Zuma","If there are any disagreements or problems between us, we should solve them before they escalate. "
"2628",2016,"Zuma","This is necessary for the common good of our country.  "
"2629",2016,"Zuma","We have had fruitful meetings with business, including the high level meeting with chief executive officers on Tuesday (9 February) this week.  "
"2630",2016,"Zuma","We have heard the suggestions from the business community on how we can turn the situation around and put the economy back on a growth path.  "

"2632",2016,"Zuma","Government is developing a One Stop Shop/Invest SA initiative to signal that South Africa is truly open for business. "
"2633",2016,"Zuma","We will fast-track the implementation of this service, in partnership with the private sector.  "
"2634",2016,"Zuma","Such an initiative requires that government removes the red tape and reviews any legislative and regulatory blockages.  "
"2635",2016,"Zuma","We have established an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Investment Promotion which will ensure the success of investment promotion initiatives.  "
"2636",2016,"Zuma","Compatriots, we have heard the concerns raised about the performance of state owned enterprises and companies.  "
"2637",2016,"Zuma","Many of our state-owned companies (SOCs) are performing well. "
"2638",2016,"Zuma","The South African National Roads Agency Limited has built some of the best roads in Gauteng and in many parts of the country. "
"2639",2016,"Zuma","These make us the envy of many parts around the globe.  "
"2640",2016,"Zuma","The Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority has constructed dams of varied capacities, thus making it possible for our people to have access to safe drinking water.  "
"2641",2016,"Zuma","Transnet has built rail infrastructure which has enabled our country’s mines to move massive bulk of commodities through our ports to markets around the globe.  "
"2642",2016,"Zuma","Eskom, in spite of the challenges, still manages to keep the economy going, against all odds.  "
"2643",2016,"Zuma","Our development finance institutions such as the Industrial Development Corporation or Development Bank of Southern Africa and others have provided finance for infrastructure, various industries and agricultural businesses without fail, even in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.  "
"2644",2016,"Zuma","For the SOCs to contribute to the successful implementation of the NDP, they must be financially sound.  "
"2645",2016,"Zuma","They must be properly governed and managed. "
"2646",2016,"Zuma","We will ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Review Commission on State-owned Enterprises, which outlines how the institutions should be managed.  "
"2647",2016,"Zuma","The Deputy President chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee which is tasked with ensuring the implementation of these recommendations.  "
"2648",2016,"Zuma","We have to streamline and sharpen the mandates of the companies and ensure that where there are overlaps in the mandates, there is immediate rationalisation.  "
"2649",2016,"Zuma","Those companies that are no longer relevant to our development agenda will be phased out.  "
"2650",2016,"Zuma","Government departments to which they report, will set the agenda and identify key projects for the SOCs to implement, over a defined period. "
"2651",2016,"Zuma","Proper monitoring and evaluation will be done.  "
"2652",2016,"Zuma","These interventions are essential for growth and also for the reduction of national debt levels.  "
"2653",2016,"Zuma","Compatriots, we must take advantage of the exchange rate as well as the recent changes of visa regulations, to boost inbound tourism.  "
"2654",2016,"Zuma","SA Tourism will invest R100 million a year to promote domestic tourism, encouraging South Africans to tour their country.  "
"2655",2016,"Zuma","We have heard concerns from companies about delays in obtaining visas for skilled personnel from abroad. "
"2656",2016,"Zuma","While we prefer that employers prioritise local workers, our migration policy must also make it possible to import scarce skills.  "
"2657",2016,"Zuma","The draft migration policy will be presented to Cabinet during the course of 2016.  "
"2658",2016,"Zuma","We have heard the appeals for policy certainty in the mining sector, especially with regards to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill.  "
"2659",2016,"Zuma","The Bill was referred back to Parliament last year. "
"2660",2016,"Zuma","We await Parliament to conclude the processing, which we trust will be done expeditiously.  "
"2661",2016,"Zuma","Compatriots, we need to empower small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) to accelerate their growth. "
"2662",2016,"Zuma","Access to high-quality, innovative business support can dramatically improve the success rate of new ventures.  "
"2663",2016,"Zuma","The Department of Small Business Development was established to provide such targeted support to small business.  "
"2664",2016,"Zuma","Economic transformation and black empowerment remain a key part of all economic programmes of government. "
"2665",2016,"Zuma","One of our new interventions is the Black Industrialists Scheme, which has been launched to promote the participation of black entrepreneurs in manufacturing.    "
"2666",2016,"Zuma","We urge big business to partner with new manufacturers including businesses owned by women and the youth, as part of broadening the ownership and control of the economy.  "
"2667",2016,"Zuma","Compatriots, we are proud of our Top 10 ranking in the World Economic Forum competitiveness report with respect to financial services.  "
"2668",2016,"Zuma","Maintaining and indeed improving our ranking is important to our competitiveness as a country.  "
"2669",2016,"Zuma","It is also fundamental to our ambition to become a financial centre for Africa.  "
"2670",2016,"Zuma","The banks, through the Banking Association of South Africa, are to launch a project aimed at establishing a centre of excellence for financial services and leadership training.  "
"2671",2016,"Zuma","This will ensure that as a country we can attract, nurture, develop and retain the best talent in financial services in our country and across our continent.  "
"2672",2016,"Zuma","They will work with the Minister of Finance and National Treasury to get this done. "
"2673",2016,"Zuma","We believe that this will over time ensure that we can expand the pool of financial skills and broaden the job opportunities for many young people.  "
"2674",2016,"Zuma","This strategic project from the banking sector is a positive and encouraging outcome of our engagement with business this week.  "
"2675",2016,"Zuma","Together we move South Africa Forward!  "
"2676",2016,"Zuma","Compatriots, we have made an undertaking to spend public funds wisely and to cut wasteful expenditure, but without compromising on the core business of government and the provision of services to our people.  "
"2677",2016,"Zuma","In 2013, the Minister of Finance announced a number of cost-containment measures.  "
"2678",2016,"Zuma","Excessive and wasteful expenditure has been reduced, but there is still more to be done to cut wastage.  "
"2679",2016,"Zuma","I would like to announce some measures this evening. "

"2685",2016,"Zuma","The executive management and boards of public agencies and SOCs must undertake similar measures. "
"2686",2016,"Zuma","I also invite Premiers of all nine provinces as well as mayors to join us as we begin eliminating wasteful expenditure within government. "
"2687",2016,"Zuma","I trust that Parliament and the judiciary will also be persuaded to consider the implementation of similar measures.  "
"2688",2016,"Zuma","Compatriots, a big expenditure item, that we would like to persuade Parliament to consider, is the maintenance of two capitals, Pretoria as the administrative one and Cape Town as the legislative capital.  "
"2689",2016,"Zuma","We believe that the matter requires the attention of Parliament soon. "
"2690",2016,"Zuma","Compatriots, we all have a lot to do to turn the economy around and to cut wastage. "

"2918",2015,"Zuma","The Department of Public Works has been instructed to ensure that all government-owned buildings are energy efficient.   "

"3113",2014,"Zuma","His passing, on the eve of the 20th year of our freedom and democracy,caused untold pain to our people and beyond our borders.  "

"3131",2014,"Zuma","We welcome her daughter Luhle and son, Sanele, and pay tribute to all families who lost their loved ones, across the political spectrum.  "
"3132",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker, Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,  We were able to overcome all that pain of the past and build a new society.  "
"3133",2014,"Zuma","We have built strong institutions of democracy.  "
"3134",2014,"Zuma","We buried the undemocratic, unrepresentative, oppressive and corrupt state that was serving a minority.  "
"3135",2014,"Zuma","We formed a unitary, non-racial, non-sexist democratic state, answerable to and representative of all South Africans.  "
"3136",2014,"Zuma","We created a thriving constitutional democracy, with well-functioning arms of the state –the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.  "
"3137",2014,"Zuma","We have Chapter 9 institutions which support democracy and protect the rights of citizens. "
"3138",2014,"Zuma","¬ Liberation and democracy have also created space for an active civil society and a free media.  "
"3139",2014,"Zuma","Liberation also brought for the first time, the promise of gender equality. "
"3140",2014,"Zuma","The representation of women in public institutions has increased considerably since the dawn of freedom, and the extension of basic services also benefits women.  "
"3141",2014,"Zuma","All these attributes have made South Africa a much better place to live in now than it has ever been.  "
"3142",2014,"Zuma","However, our country still faces the triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment, which we continue to grapple with. "
"3143",2014,"Zuma","Dealing with these challenges has become a central focus of all democratic administrations.  "
"3144",2014,"Zuma","We elected to focus on five priorities, education, health, the fight against crime and corruption, rural development and land reform as well as creating decent work.  "
"3145",2014,"Zuma","We also reorganised the State to improve performance.  "
"3146",2014,"Zuma","We created two key functions, long term planning as well as monitoring and evaluation.  "
"3147",2014,"Zuma","We established the National Planning Commission which produced the landmark National Development Plan, the country’s socio-economic blueprint and one of the major achievements of this fourth administration.  "
"3148",2014,"Zuma","The Plan outlines what we should do to eradicate poverty, increase employment and reduce inequality by 2030.  "
"3149",2014,"Zuma","Our monitoring and evaluation indicates that many services continue to improve. "
"3150",2014,"Zuma","For example, social grants and identity documents now take a shorter time to be processed. "
"3151",2014,"Zuma","But many others still require further work.  "
"3152",2014,"Zuma","I will report back on the five priorities, starting with the economy.  "
"3153",2014,"Zuma","On average, the economy has grown at 3,2 percent a year from 1994 to 2012 despite the global recession which claimed a million jobs.  "
"3154",2014,"Zuma","Working together as government, business, labour and the community sector, we nursed the economy to a recovery.  "
"3155",2014,"Zuma","The national wealth, measured in terms of GDP, has grown to more than 3.5 trillion rand.  "
"3156",2014,"Zuma","Jobs are now being created again.There are now 15 million people with jobs in the country, the highest ever in our history, and over 650 thousand jobs were created last year, according to Stats SA.  "
"3157",2014,"Zuma","This is still not good enough. "
"3158",2014,"Zuma","The unemployment rate still remains high. "
"3159",2014,"Zuma","Youth unemployment in South Africa continues to be of concern, as it is throughout the world.  "
"3160",2014,"Zuma","We are taking a number of measures, including the  Employment Tax Incentive Act which encourages employers to hire  younger workers.  "
"3161",2014,"Zuma","Regulations will be passed to ensure that this does not affect unsubsidized or older workers adversely.  "
"3162",2014,"Zuma","Further measures are contained in the National Youth Accord that was signed in Soweto last April.  "
"3163",2014,"Zuma","The Expanded Public Works Programme and the Community Work Programme continue to be an effective cushion for the poor and the youth.  "
"3164",2014,"Zuma","We have created 3,7 million work opportunities over the past five years. "
"3165",2014,"Zuma","Our people obtain an income and skills from the public works programme, which they use to seek formal employment.  "
"3166",2014,"Zuma","Cabinet has set a target of 6 million work opportunities from this year to 2019, targeting the youth.  "
"3167",2014,"Zuma","Our social assistance programme which now reaches about 16 million people, provides a safety for millions, especially vulnerable children.  "
"3168",2014,"Zuma","Imizi eminingi ithola ukusizakala ngenxa yezibonelelo zikahulumeni, imaliyezingane, impesheni yabadala neyabakhubazekile. "
"3169",2014,"Zuma","(Many households are benefiting from government grants which are child support grants, pension as well as disability grants.)  "
"3170",2014,"Zuma","Lezizibonelelo zizoqhubeka njalo ngoba imizi eminingi ithola ukusizakala ngoba amathuba emisebenzi ayivelakancane ngalesisikhathi somnotho ontengantengayo. "
"3171",2014,"Zuma","(Government will continue paying out these grants because many households highly depend on them since job opportunities are scarce during these trying times of an economic downturn.)  "
"3172",2014,"Zuma","Lamathuba atholakala kuhulumeni, enza sisho ngeqholo ukuthi, iNingizimuAfrika esiphila kuyo namhlanje, ingcono kakhulu ukunaleyo esasiphila kuyo ngaphambikuka- 1994. "
"3173",2014,"Zuma","(These opportunities, which are made available by government, are enabling us to proudly say that we are currently living in a country that is far better compared to the one we lived in before 1994.)  "
"3174",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots, We are still going through a difficult period.  "
"3175",2014,"Zuma","Developments in the United States economy have led to a rapid depreciation in the emerging market currencies, including the rand.  "
"3176",2014,"Zuma","During the course of 2013, the rand depreciated by 17.6 per cent against the US dollar.  "
"3177",2014,"Zuma","The weaker exchange rate poses a significant risk to inflation and will also make our infrastructure programme more expensive.  "
"3178",2014,"Zuma","However, export companies, particularly in the manufacturing sector, should take advantage of the weaker rand and the stronger global recovery.  "
"3179",2014,"Zuma","While we have these difficulties, we know that we can cope with this period of turbulence.  "
"3180",2014,"Zuma","We have done so before in the past five years.  "
"3181",2014,"Zuma","We will, in fact, emerge stronger if we do the right things.  "
"3182",2014,"Zuma","We have to work together as government, business and labour to grow our economy at rates that are above 5 per cent to be able to create the jobs we need.  "
"3183",2014,"Zuma","Fortunately this collaboration is already taking place.  "
"3184",2014,"Zuma","It is taking place at NEDLAC which is one of the key institutions of cooperation in our democracy, between government, business, labour and the community sector.  "
"3185",2014,"Zuma","It has taken place as well in engagements that we have been having with the business community.  "
"3186",2014,"Zuma","Last year I started engaging business on specific steps that government can take to make it easier to do business in our country.  "
"3187",2014,"Zuma","Arising out of that process, we have now streamlined regulatory and licensing approvals for environmental impact assessments, water licenses and mining licenses.  "
"3188",2014,"Zuma","Parliament is finalizing amendments to the law to give effect to this very positive development, which will cut to under 300 days, the time it takes to start a mine, from application to final approvals.  "
"3189",2014,"Zuma","The Deputy President of the Republic continues to facilitate discussions between government, mining companies and labour.  "
"3190",2014,"Zuma","The purpose is to stabilise industrial relations in this very important sector of our economy. "
"3191",2014,"Zuma","The process is yielding results.  "
"3192",2014,"Zuma","Strikes in the sector were fewer and shorter last year.  "
"3193",2014,"Zuma","And more importantly, industrial relations processes are taking place in a manner consistent with the law.  "
"3194",2014,"Zuma","We have intervened in mining  because it is one of our key job drivers. "
"3195",2014,"Zuma","We need a mining sector that works. "
"3196",2014,"Zuma","Mining employs over half a million people.  "
"3197",2014,"Zuma","It is the biggest earner of foreign exchange in our country. "
"3198",2014,"Zuma","It also contributes about 20 billion rand directly to the tax revenue.  "
"3199",2014,"Zuma","Mining also makes a far larger contribution as a buyer of goods and services, and a supplier of inputs to other sectors of our economy and other economies around the globe.  "
"3200",2014,"Zuma","We are exploring partnerships with stakeholders to address the issue of housing in mining towns.  "
"3201",2014,"Zuma","Let me also remind mining companies that 2014 is the deadline for them to improve housing and living conditions of mineworkers and to achieve a number of targets.  "
"3202",2014,"Zuma","Government continues to monitor and enforce compliance on both the company’s Social and Labour Plans and Mining Charter targets.  "
"3203",2014,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans, Honourable Members,  Other than mining, we had identified five other job drivers in 2009.  "
"3204",2014,"Zuma","These are tourism, agriculture, the green economy, infrastructure development and manufacturing.  "
"3205",2014,"Zuma","The tourism industry has grown dramatically. "
"3206",2014,"Zuma","In 1993, South Africa received a mere 3 million foreign visitors. "
"3207",2014,"Zuma","By 2012, the figure had grown to 13 million visitors.  "
"3208",2014,"Zuma","We will continue to grow this industry, given its potential for job creation.  "
"3209",2014,"Zuma","In 2012 we unveiled the National Infrastructure Plan, led by the President through the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission.  "
"3210",2014,"Zuma","We have subsequently invested one trillion rand in public infrastructure over the past five years.  "
"3211",2014,"Zuma","Many of the projects are completed or are nearing completion.  "
"3212",2014,"Zuma","I will mention just a few.  "
"3213",2014,"Zuma","The Rea Vaya system in Joburg is now used by more than 100 000 Gauteng residents. "
"3214",2014,"Zuma","Similar systems are being built in Cape Town, Tshwane, Nelson Mandela Bay, Buffalo City, eThekwini and Rustenburg.  "
"3215",2014,"Zuma","The country’s harbours and ports have been improved.  "
"3216",2014,"Zuma","We have built a 700 kilometre fuel pipeline from Durban to Gauteng  to transport 4 billion cubic litres of petrol, diesel and jet fuel a year.  "
"3217",2014,"Zuma","Close to 1 500 kilometres of new roads or lanes have been built.  "
"3218",2014,"Zuma","This progress in respect of roads reminds us of those who have served in this government before who wanted the best for the country, such as our former Transport Minister Mr Dullar Omar.  "
"3219",2014,"Zuma","His dear wife Farieda is one of our guests this evening.  "
"3220",2014,"Zuma","The construction of new rail lines has started in Mpumalanga, to ease the pressure off the roads.  "
"3221",2014,"Zuma","The Gautrain project is now fully functional and carries over 1,2 million passengers a month.  "
"3222",2014,"Zuma","The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa will spend over 120 billion rand over the next 10 years to buy new trains.  "
"3223",2014,"Zuma","Transnet is implementing its massive 300 billion rand market demand strategy, building much needed transport infrastructure.     "
"3224",2014,"Zuma","To realise the economic potential of the Western Cape and the West Coast, we launched the Saldanha Industrial Development Zone and opened two new factories in Atlantis.     "
"3225",2014,"Zuma","To improve the water supply, two large new dams were completed, De Hoop in Limpopo and Spring Grove in KwaZulu-Natal, while phase 2 of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project is to be launched soon.     "
"3226",2014,"Zuma","Construction is continuing at the new power stations, Medupi in Limpopo, Kusile in Mpumalanga and Ingula near Ladysmith, employing more than 30 000 workers.  "
"3227",2014,"Zuma","We continue to explore other sources of energy, in line with the Integrated Resource Plan for Energy.  "
"3228",2014,"Zuma","The development of petroleum, especially shale gas will be a game-changer for the Karoo region and the South African economy.  "
"3229",2014,"Zuma","Having evaluated the risks and opportunities, the final regulations will be released soon and will be followed by the processing and granting of licenses.  "
"3230",2014,"Zuma","We expect to conclude the procurement of nine thousand six hundred megawatts of nuclear energy.  "
"3231",2014,"Zuma","Biofuels manufacturers have been selected and have started work.  "
"3232",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members  Ours is indeed a country at work and is a much better place to live in. "
"3233",2014,"Zuma","We must keep the momentum.  "
"3234",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  More of our wealth is created through the internet or telecommunication.     "
"3235",2014,"Zuma","A 37 000 kilometres of fibre-optic cable has been laid by the private and public sectors in the past five years. "
"3236",2014,"Zuma","This will be significantly expanded in the years ahead.     "
"3237",2014,"Zuma","We are proud of our successes in science and technology. "
"3238",2014,"Zuma","The construction of the first telescope of the 64-dish forerunner to the Square Kilometre Array, the MeerKAT, will be completed in the first quarter of 2014.  "
"3239",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  Our incentives to boost manufacturing have yielded returns.     "
"3240",2014,"Zuma","The Automotive Investment Scheme that was launched in 2009 has approved a total 3.8 billion rand worth of incentives for about 160 investment projects. "
"3241",2014,"Zuma","These sustain more than 50 thousand jobs.     "
"3242",2014,"Zuma","The companies will be developing sedan cars, minibus taxis and buses.  "
"3243",2014,"Zuma","We have stabilised the clothing, textile, leather and footwear sector, which had been shedding jobs.  "
"3244",2014,"Zuma","Several industries have been designated for local content. "
"3245",2014,"Zuma","These include buses, canned vegetables, clothing, textiles, leather and footwear and other goods.  "
"3246",2014,"Zuma","We have concrete examples of the success of the localisation programme.  "
"3247",2014,"Zuma","In the past two years alone, more than 20 000 minibus taxis and 330 buses were assembled locally, drawing investment and development to our cities.  "
"3248",2014,"Zuma","In the next five years, the state will procure at least 75% of its goods and services from South African producers.  "
"3249",2014,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,  We have to work more intensively to develop emerging or black industrialists.  "
"3250",2014,"Zuma","Many of the aspirant black industrialists complain about the difficulties they experience in obtaining industrial finance, supplier and retail markets, and technical production support.  "
"3251",2014,"Zuma","The National Empowerment Fund, the Industrial Development Corporation and the Small Enterprise Finance Agency will continue to provide finance to viable black-owned businesses to promote industrialisation.  "
"3252",2014,"Zuma","In addition, we encourage established businesses to support the development of black industrial businesses.  "
"3253",2014,"Zuma","Agriculture is a key job driver and a provider of opportunities for entrepreneurship.  "
"3254",2014,"Zuma","Our agricultural support programme, Fetsa Tlala, is producing brand new exporters.  "
"3255",2014,"Zuma","The first 88 smallholder farmers in this programme supplied the United Nations World Food Programme with 268 tons of maize and beans to send to Lesotho last month. "
"3256",2014,"Zuma","We expect this number to increase.  "
"3257",2014,"Zuma","We will continue to promote our fisheries sector as well, which contributes an estimated 6billion rand to the economy and provides 27 000 jobs.  "
"3258",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  We have made good progress in the land reform programme.  "

"3260",2014,"Zuma","Nearly 80,000 land claims, totaling 3.4 million hectares, have been settled and 1.8 million people have benefited.  "
"3261",2014,"Zuma","The next administration will need to take forward a number of policy, legislative and practical interventions, to further redress the dispossession of our people of their land.  "
"3262",2014,"Zuma","These include matters relating to the establishment of the Office of the Valuer-General and thereby opening of the lodgement of claims.  "
"3263",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members  South Africa is indeed a much better place to live in.  "
"3264",2014,"Zuma","Let me now report on our social transformation programme.  "
"3265",2014,"Zuma","Education is a ladder out of poverty for millions of our people.  "
"3266",2014,"Zuma","We are happy therefore that there is a huge increase in the enrolment of children in school, from pre-primary to tertiary level.  "
"3267",2014,"Zuma","The number of children attending Grade R has more than doubled, moving from about 300 thousand to more than 700 thousand between 2003 and 2011.  "

"3270",2014,"Zuma","(Eight million learners are attending no-fee schools, whereas nine million learners are getting nutritious meals at school, which are provided by government to ensure that they do not suffer from starvation and that enables them to perform well.)  "
"3271",2014,"Zuma","The matric pass rate has gone up from around 61 percent in 2009 to 78 percent last year and the bachelor passes improve each year.  "
"3272",2014,"Zuma","Through the Annual National Assessments, we keep track of improvements and interventions needed, especially, in maths and science.  "

"3291",2014,"Zuma","Life expectancy is now firmly on an upward trend. "
"3292",2014,"Zuma","South Africans are now living longer.  "
"3293",2014,"Zuma","The target for the next administration is to ensure that at least 4.6 million people are enrolled in the anti-retroviral programme.  "
"3294",2014,"Zuma","We acknowledge the contribution of the South African National Aids Council for the hard work.  "
"3295",2014,"Zuma","While celebrating our success, we must not be complacent. "
"3296",2014,"Zuma","The prevention work must still continue so that we can reach that goal of zero HIV infections sooner.  "
"3297",2014,"Zuma","At a broader level, we will enter a new phase in the implementation of the National Health Insurance programme which will extend quality healthcare to the poor.   "
"3298",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,  Honourable Speaker  The overall crime rate has decreased by 21 percent since 2002 and work is ongoing to make communities safer.   "
"3299",2014,"Zuma","One of the key focus areas is to eradicate violence against women and children. "
"3300",2014,"Zuma","We have introduced a number of measures to respond to this challenge.  "
"3301",2014,"Zuma","These include the reopening of the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units as well as the Sexual Offences Courts.  "
"3302",2014,"Zuma","We thank the many NGOs that promote the rights of women and children who contribute positively to this important work.  "
"3303",2014,"Zuma","Our country continues to be the target of rhino poachers.  "
"3304",2014,"Zuma","Our law enforcement agencies are working hard to arrest this scourge.  "
"3305",2014,"Zuma","We have also reached agreements with China, Vietnam, Kenya, Mozambique and other SADC countries to work together to stop this crime.  "
"3306",2014,"Zuma","We thank the business community and all South Africans who participate in the campaign to save the rhino.  "
"3307",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots  The independence of the judiciary has been further enhanced by the establishment of the Office of the Chief Justice as a separate institution from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. "
"3308",2014,"Zuma","We have passed several pieces of legislation to support this new role of the Office of the Chief Justice.  "
"3309",2014,"Zuma","Progress is being made in the transformation of the judiciary to reflect the race and gender demographics of the country.  "
"3310",2014,"Zuma","The Chief Justice of the Republic continues to champion and lead this transformation.  "
"3311",2014,"Zuma","Black judges (African, Indian and Coloured) now constitute 61% of all judges.  "
"3312",2014,"Zuma","However, the acute under-representation of women on the bench remains of concern. "
"3313",2014,"Zuma","Of the judicial establishment of 239 judges, only 76 are women.  "
"3314",2014,"Zuma","The challenge is to transform the legal profession broadly in order to nourish the pool from which female judges can be appointed.  "
"3315",2014,"Zuma","The finalisation of the Legal Practice Bill will assist to broaden the pool from which potential judicial officers could be selected.   "
"3316",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,  South Africans are united in wanting a corruption free society. "
"3317",2014,"Zuma","Fighting corruption within the public service is yielding results.  "
"3318",2014,"Zuma","Since the launch of the National Anti-Corruption Hotline by the Public Service Commission, over 13 000 cases of corruption and maladministration have been referred to government departments for further handling and investigation.  "
"3319",2014,"Zuma","Government has recovered more than 320-million rand from perpetrators through the National Anti-Corruption Hotline.  "
"3320",2014,"Zuma","Some of the successes of the National Anti-Corruption Hotline include the following:  1 542 officials were dismissed from the Public Service. 140   officials were fined their three month salary. 20 officials were demoted 355 officials were given final written warnings. 204 officials were prosecuted. "
"3321",2014,"Zuma","To prevent corruption in the supply chain system, government has decided to establish a central tender board to adjudicate tenders in all spheres of government.  "
"3322",2014,"Zuma","This body will work with the chief procurement officer whose main function will be to check on pricing and adherence to procedures as well as fairness.  "
"3323",2014,"Zuma","The Special Investigating Unit is investigating maladministration or alleged corruption in a number of government departments and state entities, through 40 proclamations signed by the President during this administration. "
"3324",2014,"Zuma","We will keep the public informed of the outcome of the investigations.  "
"3325",2014,"Zuma","In the first six months of last year, the Asset Forfeiture Unit paid a total of 149 million rand into the Criminal Assets Recovery Account and to the victims of crime.  "
"3326",2014,"Zuma","This is 170% above its target of 55 million rand and is higher than it has ever achieved in a full year.  "
"3327",2014,"Zuma","Last year, the competition authorities investigated large-scale price fixing in the construction industry and fined guilty companies 1.4 billion rand.  "
"3328",2014,"Zuma","Further steps against those involved are now underway.  "
"3329",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots,  I would now like to touch briefly on the provision of basic services to our people.  "
"3330",2014,"Zuma","Over the past 20 years, remarkable achievements have been made in increasing access to services such as water, sanitation and electricity.  "
"3331",2014,"Zuma","Government has begun an intensive programme to eliminate  the bucket system as part of restoring the dignity of our people.  "
"3332",2014,"Zuma","Phase One of the programme will eradicate buckets in formalized townships of the Free State, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape.  "
"3333",2014,"Zuma","Phase Two will eradicate buckets in informal settlements in all provinces.  "
"3334",2014,"Zuma","In housing, about 3 million housing units and more than 855 thousand serviced sites were delivered since 1994.  "
"3335",2014,"Zuma","Nearly 500 informal settlements have been replaced with quality housing and basic services over the past five years.  "
"3336",2014,"Zuma","The next administration will promote better located mixed income housing projects.  "
"3337",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Some communities still do not have these services especially in informal settlements and rural areas.We are therefore working with all spheres of government to ensure the provision of these services, especially in the 23 municipalities with the greatest number of backlogs.  "
"3338",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots  In last year’s State of the Nation Address, I raised my concern with the manifestation of violence in some of the protests taking place in our country.  "
"3339",2014,"Zuma","Violent protests have taken place again around the country in the past few weeks.  "
"3340",2014,"Zuma","Also worrying is what appears to be premeditated violence, as is the case with the use of petrol bombs and other weapons during protests.  "
"3341",2014,"Zuma","The democratic government supports the right of citizens to express themselves.  "
"3342",2014,"Zuma","The right to protest, peacefully and unarmed, is enshrined in the Constitution.  "
"3343",2014,"Zuma","However, when protests threaten lives and property and destroy valuable infrastructure intended to serve the community, they undermine the very democracy that upholds the right to protest.  "
"3344",2014,"Zuma","The dominant narrative in the case of the protests in South Africa has been to attribute them to alleged failures of government.   "
"3345",2014,"Zuma","However the protests are not simply the result of “failures” of government but also of the success in delivering basic services.  "
"3346",2014,"Zuma","When 95% of households have access to water, the 5% who still need to be provided for, feel they cannot wait a moment longer.  "
"3347",2014,"Zuma","Success is also the breeding ground of rising expectations.  "
"3348",2014,"Zuma","Let me also add Honourable Members, that any loss of life at the hands of the police in the course of dealing with the protests cannot be overlooked or condoned.  "
"3349",2014,"Zuma","Loss of life is not a small matter. "
"3350",2014,"Zuma","We need to know what happened, why it happened. "
"3351",2014,"Zuma","Any wrongdoing must be dealt with and corrective action must be taken. "
"3352",2014,"Zuma","Police must act within the ambit of the law at all times.  "
"3353",2014,"Zuma","Having said this, we should also as a society be concerned that  between 2005 and 2013, close to 800 police officerswere killed.  "
"3354",2014,"Zuma","The police are protectors and are the buffer between a democratic society based on the rule of law, and anarchy. "
"3355",2014,"Zuma","As we hold the police to account, we should be careful not to end up delegitimising them and glorify anarchy in our society.  "
"3356",2014,"Zuma","The culture of violence originated from the apartheid past. "
"3357",2014,"Zuma","We need to conduct anintrospectionin our efforts to get rid of this scourge.  "
"3358",2014,"Zuma","As leaders from all walks of life, we must reflect on what we did or did not do, to systematically root out the violence that surfaced in protests during the early days of our democracy.   "
"3359",2014,"Zuma","We have a collective responsibility to build a society that respects the rule of law, respects one another and which respects life and property.  "
"3360",2014,"Zuma","We should work together to rebuild Ubuntu and a culture of responsibility in our society.  "
"3361",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker,  Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,  A decision has been taken to improve functioning of local government.  "
"3362",2014,"Zuma","The amendment of the Municipal Systems Act is intended to improve the capacity of municipalities to deliver services.  "
"3363",2014,"Zuma","Qualified and experienced personnel must be deployed in municipalities.  "
"3364",2014,"Zuma","We also need to strengthen existing forums of people’s participation and enable our people to play a greater role in development.  "
"3365",2014,"Zuma","The fight against corruption must be intensified as well, especially given reports that some services are interrupted or stopped, so that certain people could provide those services at cost to the state.  "
"3366",2014,"Zuma","These matters are being prioritised for the next administration.  "
"3367",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson  Democratic South Africa’s foreign policy was shaped many decades ago during the fierce international campaign to isolate the apartheid state.  "
"3368",2014,"Zuma","ANC President Oliver Tambo played a key role in that regard, assisted by among others, the late Johnny Makatini, former head of international affairs.  "
"3369",2014,"Zuma","His wife, Mrs Valerie Makatini is one of our honoured guests this evening.  "
"3370",2014,"Zuma","Africa has remained at the centre of our foreign policy.  "
"3371",2014,"Zuma","We have worked hard to strengthen support for the African Union, SADC and all continental bodies whose purpose is to achieve peace and security.  "
"3372",2014,"Zuma","We have also prioritised the promotion of regional economic integration, infrastructure development, intra-African trade and sustainable development in the continent.  "
"3373",2014,"Zuma","This year we also submitted our third country report to the AU African Peer Review Mechanism which was well received.  "
"3374",2014,"Zuma","We continue to support peacemaking and conflict resolution.  "
"3375",2014,"Zuma","Progress is being made in negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan on outstanding issues following the secession.  "
"3376",2014,"Zuma","Following requests from Sri Lanka and South Sudan for assistance in bringing about peace and reconciliation, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, has been appointed as South Africa’s Special Envoy to the two countries.  "
"3377",2014,"Zuma","His expertise in conflict resolution and negotiations as well as our country’s experience in this regard, will greatly assist the two countries to resolve their problems.  "
"3378",2014,"Zuma","We will continue to strengthen relations with Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia and countries in the South.  "
"3379",2014,"Zuma","Participation in international multilateral forums such as the G20 have been beneficial for the country.  "
"3380",2014,"Zuma","And joining the Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) group in December 2010 counts as among the key achievements of the fourth administration.  "
"3381",2014,"Zuma","It was also a great honour to host the Fifth BRICS Summit on 27 March 2013 in Durban, which saw the participation of African leaders to discuss developmental cooperation with BRICS.  "
"3382",2014,"Zuma","We will continue to serve diligently in the United Nations in promotion of strong international governance.  "
"3383",2014,"Zuma","We will also continue promoting the reform of the UN Security Council and global financial institutions.  "
"3384",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members  As President of the COP17/CMP7 United Nations Climate Change conference which was hosted in Durban in 2011, South Africa successfully placed the world on an unassailable course, through the adoption of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action.  "
"3385",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Over the past 20 years we have hosted a number of international sporting and cultural visits, which has helped to boost social cohesion and unity.  "
"3386",2014,"Zuma","In the past five years, South Africa hosted the highly successful 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup and other key soccer, rugby and cricket tournament, which left a tangible feeling of pride and unity among all South Africans.  "
"3387",2014,"Zuma","As we celebrate 20 years of freedom, we will do so having done well in building a new heritage landscape for our country.  "
"3388",2014,"Zuma","A number of new museums and monuments were established, including the statue of Former President Mandela which has become a landmark in the Union Buildings.  "
"3389",2014,"Zuma","More than 2000 geographical names have been changed in order to correct the ill-naming of places, as well as to give communities the right to determine the names of their areas.  "
"3390",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members  Allow me to acknowledge some of our compatriots who are making their mark in the world.  "
"3391",2014,"Zuma","We congratulate Ladysmith Black Mambazo on winning their fourth Grammy Award last month. "
"3392",2014,"Zuma","We welcome the group leader, Mr Joseph Shabalala, one of our guests this evening.  "
"3393",2014,"Zuma","We also acknowledge Ms Yvonne Chaka Chaka who is one of our guests this evening.  "
"3394",2014,"Zuma","She is doing a lot of good work as the United Nations Children’s Fund Goodwill Ambassador for Malaria in Africa and also the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Special Envoy for Africa.  "
"3395",2014,"Zuma","Ms Chaka Chaka was also honoured with the Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum in Davos for her humanitarian work.  "
"3396",2014,"Zuma","We also recognise, in her absence, our Oscar Award-winning Hollywood star, Ms Charlize Theron.  "
"3397",2014,"Zuma","Ms Theron is also the UN Messenger for Peace. "
"3398",2014,"Zuma","She also champions the fight against AIDS especially amongst the youth and young women.  "
"3399",2014,"Zuma","She was also honoured by the World Economic Forum with a Crystal Award.  "
"3400",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots  You would have noticed that in this SONA we have given a report of the past five yearsin particular and over the past 20 years in general.  "
"3401",2014,"Zuma","This is not an occasion to present the programme of action for this financial year. "
"3402",2014,"Zuma","That programme will be presented by the new government after the elections.  "
"3403",2014,"Zuma","To prepare for that first State of the Nation Address by the incoming administration later in the year, we have over the past year, been working on a Medium Term Strategic Framework.  "
"3404",2014,"Zuma","The Framework has been designed as the first five year building block of the National Development Plan, from 2014 to 2019.  "
"3405",2014,"Zuma","It also incorporates key targets of the Industrial Policy Action Plan, the New Growth Path and Infrastructure Plan.  "
"3406",2014,"Zuma","The intention is to table the draft Framework to the first Cabinet Lekgotla after the elections.  "
"3407",2014,"Zuma","It will be refined by the new administration in line with its electoral mandate, so that work can start as soon as possible after the formation of a new government.  "
"3408",2014,"Zuma","It has been an honour for my administration and I to build on the foundation laid by the first three democratic administrations, to serve the people of South Africa.  "
"3409",2014,"Zuma","As a country we have scored many successes.  "
"3410",2014,"Zuma","South Africa is a much better place to live in now than it was before 1994.  "
"3411",2014,"Zuma","We continue to face challenges. "
"3412",2014,"Zuma","But life will also continue to change for the better.  "
"3413",2014,"Zuma","Nkosi Sikelel’ i Africa  God Bless Afrika.  "
"3414",2014,"Zuma","I thank you."
"3415",2014,"Zuma"," The Speaker of the National Assembly, The Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, Deputy President of the Republic, Honourable Cyril Ramaphosa, Former Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, Honourable Chief Justice of the Republic, and all esteemed members of the Judiciary, Honourable Ministers and Deputy  Ministers, Premiers and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures, Chairperson of SALGA, and all local government leadership, Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders, The Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions, Leaders from all sectors, Members of the diplomatic corps, Honourable members, Distinguished guests Fellow South Africans,  Good evening, sanibonani, molweni, riperile, dumelang, ndi madekwana.  "
"3416",2014,"Zuma","It is a great pleasure to address you on this first State of the Nation Address of the fifth democratic administration.  "
"3417",2014,"Zuma","Let me begin by extending our deepest condolences on the sad passing of the Secretary of Parliament, Mr Michael Coetzee.  "
"3418",2014,"Zuma","His contribution to the struggle for freedom and democracy will never be forgotten.  "
"3419",2014,"Zuma","Last week we also lost our mother, Mama Epainette Mbeki. "
"3420",2014,"Zuma","Her guidance and wisdom will be sorely missed. "
"3421",2014,"Zuma","We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Mbeki family.  "
"3422",2014,"Zuma","Our hearts go out to the families of SANDF members who died in a tragic helicopter crash in Mpumalanga today during a training camp.  "
"3423",2014,"Zuma","We wish the injured a speedy recovery.  "
"3424",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots, We have recently emerged from a successful national general election held on the 7th of May. "
"3425",2014,"Zuma","We look forward to working with all the parties in Parliament as we move South Africa forward.  "
"3426",2014,"Zuma","In the February State of the Nation Address, I related the good story of 20 years of freedom and democracy.  "
"3427",2014,"Zuma","We stated that South Africa is a much better place to live in than it was in 1994, and that the lives of millions of our people have improved.  "
"3428",2014,"Zuma","However, as the National Development Plan and the Presidency Twenty Year Review highlight, the triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment continue to affect the lives of many people.  "
"3429",2014,"Zuma","As we enter the second phase of our transition from apartheid to a national democratic society, we have to embark on radical socio-economic transformation to push back the triple challenges.  "
"3430",2014,"Zuma","Change will not come about without some far-reaching interventions.  "
"3431",2014,"Zuma","We have put in place a programme of action based on the ANC Manifesto and the National Development Plan.  "
"3432",2014,"Zuma","The economy takes centre stage in this programme.  "
"3433",2014,"Zuma","It remains our strong belief that the most effective weapon in the campaign against poverty, is the creation of decent work, and that creating work requires faster economic growth.  "
"3434",2014,"Zuma","We have set a growth target of 5 per cent by 2019. "
"3435",2014,"Zuma","To achieve this, we will embark on various measures and interventions to jump-start the economy.  "
"3436",2014,"Zuma","We have set this target during a difficult period. "
"3437",2014,"Zuma","The economy has grown below its potential over the last three years and many households are going through difficulties.  "
"3438",2014,"Zuma","The slow growth has been caused in part by the global economic slowdown and secondly by domestic conditions, such as the prolonged and at times violent strikes, and also the shortage of energy.  "
"3439",2014,"Zuma","Given the impact of the untenable labour relations environment on the economy, it is critical for social partners to meet and deliberate on the violent nature and duration of the strikes.  "
"3440",2014,"Zuma","The social partners will also need to deliberate on wage inequality. "
"3441",2014,"Zuma","On our side as Government we will during this term investigate the possibility of a national minimum wage as one of the key mechanisms to reduce the income inequality.  "
"3442",2014,"Zuma","Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will convene the social partners dialogue, within the ambit of NEDLAC.  "
"3443",2014,"Zuma","Secondly, Government will play its part in the implementation of the landmark Framework Agreement for a Sustainable Mining Industry entered into by labour, business and government last year, under the leadership of former Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe.  "
"3444",2014,"Zuma","The process will now be led by the President.  "
"3445",2014,"Zuma","We will implement the undertaking to build housing and other services to revitalize mining towns, as part of the October 2012 agreement between business, government and labour.  "
"3446",2014,"Zuma","The focus is the mining areas of Motlosana, Emalahleni, Sekhukhune, Lephalale, West Rand and Matjhabeng.  "
"3447",2014,"Zuma","An Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Revitalisation of Distressed Mining Communities has been established under the leadership of the Minister in the Presidency responsible for Planning, Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Mr Jeff Radebe.   "
"3448",2014,"Zuma","The members of the committee include the Ministers of Mineral Resources, Water and Sanitation, Trade and Industry, Social Development, Labour, Human Settlements, Health, Economic Development and Finance.  "
"3449",2014,"Zuma","To further promote improved living conditions for mine workers, Government is monitoring the compliance of mining companies with Mining Charter targets, relating to improving the living conditions of workers.  "
"3450",2014,"Zuma","Companies are expected to convert or upgrade hostels into family units, attain the occupancy rate of one person per room and also facilitate home ownership options for mine workers. "
"3451",2014,"Zuma","We urge the companies to meet the 2014 deadline for these targets and extend this right to dignity to mine workers.  "
"3452",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Members Distinguished guests, The low level of investments is a key constraint to economic growth. "
"3453",2014,"Zuma","We are determined to work with the private sector to remove obstacles to investment.  "
"3454",2014,"Zuma","We would like to see the private sector showing as much confidence in the economy as the public sector.  "
"3455",2014,"Zuma","We will continue to engage business in promoting inclusive growth and to build a more prosperous society. "
"3456",2014,"Zuma","In this regard, I will soon convene a meeting of the Presidential Business Working Group.  "
"3457",2014,"Zuma","After the last meeting of the Working Group last year, six work streams were established and these have been discussing solutions to various obstacles to doing business in South Africa.  "
"3458",2014,"Zuma","These issues were also raised by owners and CEOs of major companies that I hosted in three separate, intensive working sessions at the Mahlamba Ndlopfu residence in November and December last year.   "
"3459",2014,"Zuma","The next meeting of the Working Group will take forward the partnership for inclusive growth and sustainable development.  "
"3460",2014,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans, We need to respond decisively to the country’s energy constraints in order to create a conducive environment for growth.  "
"3461",2014,"Zuma","The successful electrification programme which has changed the lives of many households was achieved by tapping into artificial electricity reserves, which had not been designed to cater for mass energy distribution.  "
"3462",2014,"Zuma","This situation calls for a radical transformation of the energy sector, to develop a sustainable energy mix that comprises coal, solar, wind, hydro, gas and nuclear energy.  "
"3463",2014,"Zuma","The transformation will require structural changes in the manner in which government departments, affected state owned companies and the industry as a whole address the energy challenges.  "
"3464",2014,"Zuma","The energy plan also calls for the injection of capital and human resources into the energy sector.  "
"3465",2014,"Zuma","We will also need to identify innovative approaches to fast-track procurement and delivery by government in the energy sector.  "
"3466",2014,"Zuma","To prepare the institutional capacity, we are in the process of converting the National Nuclear and Energy Executive Coordinating Committee of Cabinet, into the Energy Security Cabinet Sub-committee.   "
"3467",2014,"Zuma","The sub-committee will be responsible for the oversight, coordination and direction of activities for the energy sector.  "
"3468",2014,"Zuma","The sub-committee will also ensure that Eskom receives the support it requires to fulfil its mandate and that it remains focused on achieving its goals and targets.  "
"3469",2014,"Zuma","To achieve our energy security goals, state owned companies involved in the Energy Sector, such as Eskom, South African Nuclear Energy Corporation and the Central Energy Fund will have to adapt to the redefined roles to achieve these objectives.  "
"3470",2014,"Zuma","Work needs to be done at a technical level on all forms of energy especially nuclear energy and shale gas with regards to funding, safety, exploitation and the local manufacture of components.  "
"3471",2014,"Zuma","Nuclear has the possibility of generating well over 9000 megawatts, while shale gas is recognised as a game changer for our economy.  "
"3472",2014,"Zuma","We will pursue the shale gas option within the framework of our good environmental laws.  "
"3473",2014,"Zuma","There are also some urgent activities that we are engaging in, in the short term. "
"3474",2014,"Zuma","Progress at Medupi power station construction site will be accelerated.  "
"3475",2014,"Zuma","Plans on the financing of the next large coal fired power station, Coal 3, will be speeded up so that the procurement process can commence.  "
"3476",2014,"Zuma","We will also continue the 4th window of the renewable energy independent power producers programme, to take advantage of wind, solar, biomass and other technologies that increase the opportunity for rural development.  "
"3477",2014,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,  We are also looking beyond our borders for energy security.  "
"3478",2014,"Zuma","In October last year we signed the Grand Inga Hydro Power Project Treaty with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo. "
"3479",2014,"Zuma","This massive and strategic project has the potential to generate 40 000 megawatts of hydro-electricity.  "
"3480",2014,"Zuma","Our country will benefit enormously from this milestone project.  "
"3481",2014,"Zuma","To prepare for the implementation of the energy plan, we need to finalise the legislation that relates to the restructuring of the energy industry as envisaged by the Independent System Market Operator Bill, the Integrated Resource Plan and other policies affecting the Energy sector.

"3505",2014,"Zuma","However, their impact on development is not sufficiently broad-based and their investment programmes are not well coordinated.  "
"3506",2014,"Zuma","The institutions will be repositioned in the next five years to become real engines of socio-economic development.  "
"3507",2014,"Zuma","In the same vein, Postbank will be supported so that it can play a leading role in the expansion of banking services to the poor and the working class.  "

"3580",2014,"Zuma","South Africa is becoming an urban country. "
"3581",2014,"Zuma","By 2011 almost 63% of our population were residing in towns and cities and this trend is expected to continue over the coming decade.  "
"3582",2014,"Zuma","Our government’s Integrated Urban Development Framework will be finalised by 30 July 2014.  "

"3585",2014,"Zuma","Together let us move local government forward!  "
"3586",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots Over the past twenty years, we have steadily expanded support for marginalised and vulnerable households through investments in housing, extensions to our social grants programmes and improved access to education and primary health care.  "
"3587",2014,"Zuma","Over the period ahead, poverty reduction will continue to be reinforced.  "
"3588",2014,"Zuma","We will continue to invest in education and skills development as that is the key to economic growth and development. "

"3590",2014,"Zuma","Education therefore remains an apex priority for this government. "

"3592",2014,"Zuma","We will increase the number of Grade 12 learners who can gain entrance to university, moving from 172 000 in 2013 to 250 000 in 2019.  "

"3601",2014,"Zuma","The campaign to reduce child and maternal mortality ratios will continue.  "
"3602",2014,"Zuma","This will require the  implementation of the National Health Insurance and the improvement of the quality of care in the public sector.  "

"3610",2014,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans Some progress has been made over the past five years in reducing the levels of serious crime such as murders, aggravated robberies, crimes against women, children and other vulnerable groups, but they remain unacceptably high.  "

"3614",2014,"Zuma","Weaknesses in procurement, management and operations systems that undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of government will be addressed.  "
"3615",2014,"Zuma","One of the key steps, which is already underway, is to centralise procurement under the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer in the National Treasury.  "
"3616",2014,"Zuma","We have begun piloting this new approach with the centralised procurement of school furniture in the Eastern Cape. "
"3617",2014,"Zuma","The furniture will be delivered in all Eastern Cape schools by the middle of August 2014.  "
"3618",2014,"Zuma","Measures will be introduced to prevent public servants and public representatives from doing business with the state.  "

"3620",2014,"Zuma","Compatriots Over the next five years we will continue to promote the building of a better Africa and a more just world.  "

"3654",2013,"Zuma","It is a roadmap to a South Africa where all will have water, electricity, sanitation, jobs, housing, public transport, adequate nutrition, education, social protection, quality healthcare, recreation and a clean environment.  "
"3655",2013,"Zuma","The achievement of these goals has proven to be difficult in the recent past, due the global economic recession.  "
"3656",2013,"Zuma","The crisis in the Eurozone affects our economy as the Eurozone is our major trading partner, accounting for around 21 per cent of our exports.  "
"3657",2013,"Zuma","Our GDP growth is expected to average at 2.5% cent, down from 3.1% in the previous year.  "

"3662",2013,"Zuma","We will engage business, labour and other social partners in pursuit of solutions. "
"3663",2013,"Zuma","No single force acting individually can achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves.  "
"3664",2013,"Zuma","Honourable Members, I would now like to report on progress made since the last State of the Nation Address and also to discuss our programme of action for 2013.  "

"3668",2013,"Zuma","Various projects are being implemented around the country. "

"3670",2013,"Zuma","The construction of the first phase of the Mokolo and Crocodile River Water Augmentation has commenced and it will provide part of the water required for the Matimba and the Medupi power stations.  "
"3671",2013,"Zuma","The construction of the bulk water distribution system for the De Hoop Dam began in October 2012, to supply water to the Greater Sekhukhune, Waterberg and Capricorn district municipalities.  "

"3709",2013,"Zuma","Honourable Members, The past two years have demonstrated that where the state intervenes strongly and consistently, it can turn around key industries that face external or internal threats as has happened in our manufacturing sector.  "

"3750",2013,"Zuma","Later this year, the Minister of Finance will be commissioning a study of our current tax policies, to make sure that we have an appropriate revenue base to support public spending. "
"3751",2013,"Zuma","Part of this study, will evaluate the current mining royalties regime, with regard to its ability to suitably serve our people.  "
"3752",2013,"Zuma","Honourable Members, Distinguished guests,  In last year’s address we raised the issue of the gap market, the people who earn too much to qualify for an RDP house and too little for a bank mortgage bond.  "
"3753",2013,"Zuma","From April 2012 to December 2012, Provincial Departments committed a budget of 126 million rand of the Human Settlements Development Grant for this programme, known as the Finance Linked Individual Subsidy programme.  "
"3754",2013,"Zuma","The money is being used through the National Housing Finance Corporation, which has been appointed to deliver houses to people within the Gap market in twelve registered projects.  "
"3755",2013,"Zuma","A total of 70 million rand of this amount has been used to date.  "
"3756",2013,"Zuma","Projects include Walmer Link in the Eastern Cape, Lady Selbourne, Nelmapius, Bohlabela Borwa, Cosmo City and Fleurhof in Gauteng, Intabazwe Corridor Housing in the Free State and Seraleng in North West.  "

"3761",2013,"Zuma","Honourable members,  The Annual National Assessments in our schools, have become a powerful tool of assessing the health of our education system.   "
"3762",2013,"Zuma","We welcome the improvement each year in the ANA results, but more must be done to improve maths, science and technology.  "
"3763",2013,"Zuma","The Department of Basic Education will establish a national task team to strengthen the implementation of the Mathematics, Science and Technology Strategy.  "
"3764",2013,"Zuma","We urge the private sector to partner government through establishing, adopting or sponsoring maths and science academies or Saturday schools.  "
"3765",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots, We are pleased with the growth of our early childhood education programmes, including Grade R.  "
"3766",2013,"Zuma","We are also pleased with our adult education programme, Khari Gude, which has reached more than 2,2 million people between 2008 and 2011.   "
"3767",2013,"Zuma","We also continue to encourage people from all walks never to stop learning.  "
"3768",2013,"Zuma","Many were inspired when accomplished musician and my special guest, Mr Sipho Hotstix Mabuse obtained his matric last year, at the age of 60.  "
"3769",2013,"Zuma","Honourable Members, We declared education as an apex priority in 2009. "
"3770",2013,"Zuma","We want to see everyone in the country realising that education is an essential service for our nation.  "
"3771",2013,"Zuma","By saying education is an essential service we are not taking away the Constitutional rights of teachers as workers such as the right to strike.  "
"3772",2013,"Zuma","It means we want the education sector and society as a whole to take education more seriously than is happening currently.  "
"3773",2013,"Zuma","All successful societies have one thing in common – they invested in education. "
"3774",2013,"Zuma","Decent salaries and conditions of service will play an important role in attracting, motivating and retaining skilled teachers.  "
"3775",2013,"Zuma","In this regard, we will establish a Presidential Remuneration Commission which will investigate the appropriateness of the remuneration and conditions of service provided by the State to all its employees.  "
"3776",2013,"Zuma","I have directed that the first priority should be teachers.  "
"3777",2013,"Zuma","The Commission will also assess the return on investment.  "
"3778",2013,"Zuma","In elevating education to its rightful place, we want to see an improvement in the quality of learning and teaching and the management of schools. "
"3779",2013,"Zuma","We want to see an improvement in attitudes, posture and outcomes.  "
"3780",2013,"Zuma","Working with educators, parents, the community and various stakeholders, we will be able to turn our schools into centres of excellence.  "
"3781",2013,"Zuma","Honourable Members, Five years ago, South Africa had such a low life expectancy that experts suggested that by 2015, our life expectancy would have been exactly where it was in 1955.  "
"3782",2013,"Zuma","It was with good reason that we were delighted when late last year, studies from the Medical Research Council, the Lancet medical journal and others began reporting a dramatic increase in life expectancy from an average baseline of 56 years in 2009 to 60 years in 2011. "
"3783",2013,"Zuma","These reports also noted significant decreases in infant and under five mortality.  "
"3784",2013,"Zuma","Increased life expectancy is a key to the country’s development. "
"3785",2013,"Zuma","People are returning to work, they are being productive, economically and socially.  "
"3786",2013,"Zuma","The family structure is increasingly stable and parents live longer and are able to take care of their children.  "
"3787",2013,"Zuma","We should not become complacent, in light of these achievements.  "
"3788",2013,"Zuma","Given the high co-infection rate between HIV and TB, we have integrated these services.  "
"3789",2013,"Zuma","Work is also continuing on the research side. "
"3790",2013,"Zuma","South Africa has discovered a candidate drug to treat Malaria.  "
"3791",2013,"Zuma","In addition, researchers at the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa consortium, also discovered broad neutralising antibodies against HIV.  "
"3792",2013,"Zuma","Deputy President Motlanthe has appointed new members of the South African National Aids Council Trust. "
"3793",2013,"Zuma","We congratulate the team, which is led by retired Judge Zac Yacoob, as chairperson.  "
"3794",2013,"Zuma","Diseases of lifestyle are on an alarming increase.  "
"3795",2013,"Zuma","We have to combat and lower the levels of smoking, harmful effects of alcohol, poor diets and obesity.  "
"3796",2013,"Zuma","Honourable members, In 2014 we will create the National Health Insurance Fund. "
"3797",2013,"Zuma","The Department of Health will accelerate and intensify progress in the pilot districts.   "
"3798",2013,"Zuma","In that regard, as from April this year, the first group of approximately 600 private medical practitioners will be contracted to provide medical services at 533 clinics within villages and townships in 10 of the pilot districts.   "
"3799",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends, In June we will mark the centenary of the 1913 Land Act which turned black people into wanderers, labourers and pariahs in their own land.  "
"3800",2013,"Zuma","Former ANC President Sefako Makgatho outlined as such in his 1919 ANC conference presidential address.  "
"3801",2013,"Zuma","He said; “The Native Land Act still operates as mercilessly in different parts of the Union, and as a result many native families are still working for white farmers only for their food’’.  "
"3802",2013,"Zuma","We are also honoured, in this year of the anniversary of the 1913 Land Act, to have present among us, Mrs Nomhlangano Beauty Mkhize, one of the veterans who together with her husband, Saul Mkhize, led the struggle against forced removals in Driefontein and Daggaskraal, in the present Mpumalanga Province.  "
"3803",2013,"Zuma","The land question is a highly emotive matter.  "
"3804",2013,"Zuma","We need to resolve it amicably within the framework of the Constitution and the law.  "
"3805",2013,"Zuma","I received a message on Facebook from Thulani Zondi who raised his concern about the slow pace of land redistribution. "
"3806",2013,"Zuma","He said:  “Mr President, as we are commemorating 100 years since the Land act of 1913 was introduced to dispossess the African majority.  "
"3807",2013,"Zuma","“I urge you to accelerate redistribution of the land to the landless African people.  "
"3808",2013,"Zuma","“When we do the redistribution we need to be mindful of food security. "
"3809",2013,"Zuma","Training and mentorship of emerging black commercial farmers must take place”.  "
"3810",2013,"Zuma","From 1994, we have been addressing the land reform problem through restitution, redistribution and tenure reform.  "
"3811",2013,"Zuma","As stated before, we will not be able to meet our redistribution targets.  "
"3812",2013,"Zuma","Government’s mid-term review last year revealed a number of shortcomings in our land reform implementation programme. "
"3813",2013,"Zuma","We will use those lessons to improve implementation.  "
"3814",2013,"Zuma","Firstly, we must shorten the time it takes to finalise a claim. "
"3815",2013,"Zuma","In this regard, Government will now pursue the ‘just and equitable’ principle for compensation, as set out in the Constitution instead of the “willing buyer, willing seller” principle, which forces the state to  pay more for land than the actual value.  "
"3816",2013,"Zuma","Secondly there are proposed amendments to the Restitution of Land Rights Act, 1994 in order to provide for the re-opening of the lodgement of restitution claims, by people who missed the deadline of 31 December 1998.  "
"3817",2013,"Zuma","Also to be explored, are exceptions to the June 1913 cut-off date to accommodate claims by the descendants of the Khoi and San as well as heritage sites and historical landmarks.  "
"3818",2013,"Zuma","Another key lesson is to provide adequate post-settlement support to new landowners so that land continues to be productive.  "
"3819",2013,"Zuma","We also need to provide better incentives for commercial farmers that are willing and capable of mentoring smallholder farmers.  "
"3820",2013,"Zuma","Another challenge we have faced is the preference for money instead of land by some claimants, which also does not help us to change land ownership patterns.  "
"3821",2013,"Zuma","As part of the Presidency stakeholder engagement programme ahead of the State of the Nation Address, Deputy President Motlanthe held a meeting with both farmers and farm workers in Paarl on Tuesday.  "
"3822",2013,"Zuma","Stakeholders agreed that there should be peace and stability in the agriculture sector and that the living and working conditions of farm workers should be improved urgently. "
"3823",2013,"Zuma","It is also encouraging that even the farmers called for the fast tracking of land reform and support to emerging farmers.  "
"3824",2013,"Zuma","We will continue the engagement with both farmers and farm workers.  "
"3825",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends, We should also remain mindful of rapid urbanisation that is taking place. "
"3826",2013,"Zuma","The Census Statistics reveal that 63% of the population are living in urban areas. "
"3827",2013,"Zuma","This is likely to increase to over 70% by 2030.  "
"3828",2013,"Zuma","Apartheid spatial patterns still persist in our towns and cities. "
"3829",2013,"Zuma","Municipalities alone cannot deal with the challenges. "
"3830",2013,"Zuma","We need a national approach.    "
"3831",2013,"Zuma","While rural development remains a priority of government, it is crucial that we also develop a national integrated urban development framework to assist municipalities to effectively manage rapid urbanisation.  "
"3832",2013,"Zuma","As part of implementing the National Development Plan, all three spheres of government need to manage the new wave of urbanisation in ways that also contribute to rural development.   "
"3833",2013,"Zuma","Honourable Members, Improving the status of women remains a critical priority for this government.  "
"3834",2013,"Zuma","The Bill on Gender Equality and Women Empowerment has been approved by Cabinet for public comment. "
"3835",2013,"Zuma","The Bill criminalizes practices that have adverse effects on women and girls.  "
"3836",2013,"Zuma","It also legislates the 50/50 policy position with regard to the representation of women in decision making structures.  "
"3837",2013,"Zuma","Honourable members, The brutal gang rape and murder of Anene Booysen and other women and girls in recent times has brought into sharp focus the need for unity in action to eradicate this scourge.  "
"3838",2013,"Zuma","The brutality and cruelty meted out to defenceless women is unacceptable and has no place in our country. "
"3839",2013,"Zuma","Last year the National Council on Gender Based Violence was established.   "
"3840",2013,"Zuma","It comprises government, non-governmental Organizations, Community-Based Organizations, Faith-Based organizations, academia, research institutions, government, men’s groupings, and representation from women, children and persons with disabilities.  "
"3841",2013,"Zuma","We urge this coordinating structure to make the campaign of fighting violence against women an everyday campaign.  "
"3842",2013,"Zuma","We applaud all sectors for the campaigns that have taken place already, highlighting that such acts will not be tolerated.  "
"3843",2013,"Zuma","I have directed law enforcement agencies to treat these cases with the utmost urgency and importance. "
"3844",2013,"Zuma","The Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units, which were re-established in 2010, have increased personnel.  "
"3845",2013,"Zuma","During the last financial year, the Units secured over 363 life sentences, with a conviction rate of 73% for crimes against women above 18 years old and 70% for crimes against children under 18 years of age.   "
"3846",2013,"Zuma","Masibhunkule sisebenze sonke, silwe nalenkinga esibhekene nayo yabantu abadlwengula omame nezingane, ngisho nezalukazi imbala. "
"3847",2013,"Zuma","Ihlazo nobunswelaboya obesabekayo lokhu abakwenzayo. "
"3848",2013,"Zuma","Izigilamkhuba kufanele zibikwe emaphoyiseni ziboshwe.  "
"3849",2013,"Zuma","Government is adding other mechanisms to protect women, such as the Protection from Harassment Bill. "
"3850",2013,"Zuma","While the Domestic Violence Act also provides protection, it only applies to persons who are in a domestic relationship.  "
"3851",2013,"Zuma","The Protection from Harassment Bill also deals with harassment by persons who stalk their victims by means of electronic communications.   "
"3852",2013,"Zuma","In addition, the Combating of Trafficking in Persons Bill was passed by the National Assembly last year and is now at the National Council of Provinces.  "
"3853",2013,"Zuma","Once implemented, the law will  assist women and children, who are often victims of this heinous crime.  "
"3854",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends, There is increased visibility of the police which contributes to the reduction in the levels of serious crime.  "
"3855",2013,"Zuma","The operations focusing on illegal firearms, stolen and robbed vehicles, liquor and drugs which are regarded as main generators of crime have assisted in crime reduction. "
"3856",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends,  Government continues to wage a war against corruption.  "
"3857",2013,"Zuma","The capacity of the Special Investigating Unit has grown from an initial 70 staff members to more than 600 at present.  "
"3858",2013,"Zuma","I have since 2009, signed 34 proclamations directing the SIU to investigate allegations of corruption, fraud or maladministration in various government departments and state entities.  "
"3859",2013,"Zuma","Criminal Investigations were initiated against 203 accused persons in 67 priority cases under investigation by the end September 2012.  "
"3860",2013,"Zuma","In total, pre-trial proceedings have been initiated against 191 persons. "
"3861",2013,"Zuma","A total of 66 persons under investigation are alleged to have received R5 million or more benefits through corruption. "
"3862",2013,"Zuma","Freezing Orders were obtained against 46 persons.  "
"3863",2013,"Zuma","In other successes, in the past financial year, 107 officials working within the criminal justice system were convicted.   "
"3864",2013,"Zuma","The Asset Forfeiture Unit seized assets valued at more than R541 million. "
"3865",2013,"Zuma","A total of R61 million of these assets have already been forfeited to the State. "
"3866",2013,"Zuma","The assets are channelled back to fighting crime and corruption through the Criminal Asset Recovery Account.  "
"3867",2013,"Zuma","Last year, additional funding of R150 million from the Criminal Assets Recovery Account was approved for the work of the Anti-Corruption Task Team which comprises the Hawks, the Special Investigating Unit and the National Prosecuting Authority.   "
"3868",2013,"Zuma","These resources are aimed at strengthening the capacity of these law enforcement agencies in our resolve to fight corruption.  "
"3869",2013,"Zuma","We urge the private sector to also take this fight against corruption seriously so that we tackle it from all angles.  "
"3870",2013,"Zuma","To further boost the fight against corruption, we will fill all vacant posts at the upper echelons of the criminal justice system.  "
"3871",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends, Honourable Members, There are some lessons from Marikana and other incidents that we cannot allow to recur in our country.  "
"3872",2013,"Zuma","Our Constitution is truly one of our greatest national achievements.   "
"3873",2013,"Zuma","Everything that we do as a government is guided by our Constitution and its vision of the society we are building.  "
"3874",2013,"Zuma","We call on all citizens to celebrate, promote and defend our Constitution.  "
"3875",2013,"Zuma","Our Bill of Rights guarantees that “everyone has the right, peacefully and unarmed,  to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions”.   "
"3876",2013,"Zuma","We therefore call on our people to exercise their rights to protest in a peaceful and orderly manner.  "
"3877",2013,"Zuma","It is unacceptable when people’s rights are violated by perpetrators of violent actions, such as actions that lead to injury and death of persons, damage to property and the destruction of valuable public infrastructure.  "
"3878",2013,"Zuma","We are duty bound to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic. "
"3879",2013,"Zuma","We will spare no effort in doing so.  "
"3880",2013,"Zuma","For this reason, I have instructed the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security (JCPS) Cluster to put measures in place, with immediate effect, to ensure that any incidents of violent protest are acted upon, investigated and prosecuted.  "
"3881",2013,"Zuma","Courts will be allocated to deal with such cases on a prioritised roll. "
"3882",2013,"Zuma","The law must be enforced and it must be seen to be enforced - fairly, effectively and expeditiously.  "
"3883",2013,"Zuma","The citizens of our country have a right to expect that their democratic state will exercise its authority in defence of the Constitution that so many struggled so long and hard for. "
"3884",2013,"Zuma","We cannot disappoint  this expectation. "
"3885",2013,"Zuma","The JCPS Cluster has therefore put measures in place at national, provincial and local level to deal with such incidents effectively. "
"3886",2013,"Zuma","Let me hasten to add that government departments at all levels must work closely with communities and ensure that all concerns are attended to before they escalate.  "
"3887",2013,"Zuma","That responsibility remains. "
"3888",2013,"Zuma","We are a caring government.  "
"3889",2013,"Zuma","Honourable Members, This year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Organization of African Unity which has been succeeded by the African Union.  "
"3890",2013,"Zuma","We pay tribute to the OAU for its relentless struggle for the decolonization of our continent, including contributing to our own freedom.  "
"3891",2013,"Zuma","We will continue to work for a stronger and more effective organization of our Union. "

"3894",2013,"Zuma","On peace and security, we stand by the people of Mali in their effort to claim and assert the territorial integrity of their country.  "
"3895",2013,"Zuma","We urge the leadership in the Central African Republic, Guinea Bissau and Somalia to continue their march towards lasting peace for the sake of their people. "
"3896",2013,"Zuma","We remain firmly opposed to unconstitutional change of government.   "
"3897",2013,"Zuma","We are encouraged by the developments between Sudan and South Sudan. "
"3898",2013,"Zuma","We commend our former President Thabo Mbeki and other members of the AU High Level Panel for the dedicated manner in which they have been working with the two sides.   "
"3899",2013,"Zuma","We are in solidarity with the DRC as the country battles the menace to its security.  "
"3900",2013,"Zuma","South Africa will continue supporting Africa's peace efforts including through mediation, troop contribution for peace keeping, and by providing material and financial assistance.  "
"3901",2013,"Zuma","In this regard, we look forward to the conclusion of political dialogues in Zimbabwe and Madagascar.   "
"3902",2013,"Zuma","Our vision of a better Africa in a better world will receive great impetus when we host the 5th BRICS Summit next month in Durban.  "
"3903",2013,"Zuma","We are inspired by the exponential growth of bilateral relations, diplomatically and economically, between South Africa and other BRICS countries.  "
"3904",2013,"Zuma","Strengthening North-South relations remains central to our foreign policy agenda.  "
"3905",2013,"Zuma","We reaffirm our partnership with countries of the North, especially the USA, Europe and Japan.  "
"3906",2013,"Zuma","The UN’s 70th anniversary provides an opportunity to take forward the transformation of the UN Security Council.  "
"3907",2013,"Zuma","We shall continue to use the G20 to represent the aspirations of the people of Africa and push for the transformation of Bretton Woods institutions.  "
"3908",2013,"Zuma","South Africa’s internationalism has a strong element of solidarity to it.  "
"3909",2013,"Zuma","We stand with the people of Palestine as they strive to turn a new leaf in their struggle for their right to self-determination; hence we supported their bid for statehood.  "
"3910",2013,"Zuma","The expansion of Israeli settlements into Palestinian territories is a serious stumbling block to the resolution of the conflict.  "
"3911",2013,"Zuma","The right of self determination for the people of Western Sahara has to be realised.  "
"3912",2013,"Zuma","We remain firm in our call for the lifting of the economic embargo against Cuba.  "
"3913",2013,"Zuma","Working together we can do more to create a better Africa and a better world.  "
"3914",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots,  In the year 2012, we focused on preserving and promoting our country’s cultural heritage with particular emphasis on our liberation heritage.  "
"3915",2013,"Zuma","We also hosted a historic National Summit on Social Cohesion, focusing on building a socially inclusive, caring and proud nation.  "
"3916",2013,"Zuma","In the implementation of our programme we will work with our Social Cohesion Advocates; eminent South Africans drawn from a variety of sectors within our society.  "
"3917",2013,"Zuma","We are proud to have in our midst this evening, two of our eminent social cohesion advocates, Judge Yvonne Mokgoro and Advocate George Bizos. "
"3918",2013,"Zuma","Compatriots,  This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Raid on Liliesleaf Farm, the Escape from Marshall Square as well as the Start of the Rivonia Trial.  "

"3943",2012,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  Compatriots and friends,  The year 2012 is also special because it marks the 16th anniversary of the Constitution of the Republic, which gives full expression to our democratic ideals.  "

"3945",2012,"Zuma","s fundamental vision statement, which guides our policies and actions. "
"3946",2012,"Zuma","We reaffirm our commitment to advance the ideals of our country?"
"3947",2012,"Zuma","s Constitution at all times.  "
"3948",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends,  At the January Cabinet lekgotla, we decided to undertake a mid-term review, looking at progress from 2009 till now instead of the usual annual review.  "
"3949",2012,"Zuma","The mid-term review indicated steady progress in various areas such as health, education, the fight against crime, human settlements, energy, water provision, rural development and others.  "
"3950",2012,"Zuma","However, the triple challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality persists, despite the progress made. "
"3951",2012,"Zuma","Africans, women and the youth continue to suffer most from this challenge.  "
"3952",2012,"Zuma","Somlomo nosihlalo abahloniphekileyo,  Njengekhabhinethi kazwelonke sithathe isinqumo sokuthi kufanele senze ngokwedlulele, ukukhulisa umnotho wezwe, ukuze siqede lezizinkinga zokwesweleka kwemisebenzi, ubumpofu kanye nokungalingani ezweni.  "
"3953",2012,"Zuma","Ilezo zinto ezintathu esizobhekana nazo ngqo, kulonyaka naseminyakeni ezayo.  "
"3954",2012,"Zuma","(Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson  As a national Cabinet, we have taken the decision that we should do more to grow the country?"
"3955",2012,"Zuma","s economy, in order to get rid of the problems of unemployment, poverty and inequality in the country.  "
"3956",2012,"Zuma","Those are the three things that we will face head on, this year and in the coming years.)  "
"3957",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots,  When freedom was attained in 1994, South Africa inherited a problem of structural unemployment which goes back to the 1970s. "
"3958",2012,"Zuma","Employment continued to deteriorate in the 1990s and the early 2000s due to slow growth and declining employment in gold mining and agriculture.  "
"3959",2012,"Zuma","Although jobs grew rapidly during the boom of 2003 to 2008, unemployment did not fall below 20%.  "
"3960",2012,"Zuma","Employment received another setback in the recession of 2009.  "
"3961",2012,"Zuma","Fortunately, Government entered the 2008-2009 recession with healthy public finances, and a comparatively low level of debt.  "
"3962",2012,"Zuma","This allowed for a flexible response to deteriorating economic conditions.  "
"3963",2012,"Zuma","For example, we increased spending on social security and on infrastructure development to stimulate the economy, mainly through the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup build programme.  "
"3964",2012,"Zuma","Informed by some of these difficulties and the need to move away from piecemeal planning, we took a decision in 2009 to establish the National Planning Commission and asked them to produce a national development plan for the country, informed by the Constitution of the Republic.  "
"3965",2012,"Zuma","The Commission released the first draft of the National Development Plan [PDF] for consideration, which looks at where we want to be in 20 years? "
"3966",2012,"Zuma","time.  "
"3967",2012,"Zuma","The Plan also directly addresses the elimination of poverty and inequality as critical points that must be attended to.  "
"3968",2012,"Zuma","The solution for the country therefore, is higher growth and job creation to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty and inequality.  "
"3969",2012,"Zuma","As a developmental state that is located at the centre of a mixed economy, we see our role as being to lead and guide the economy and to intervene in the interest of the poor, given the history of our country.  "
"3970",2012,"Zuma","Informed by this responsibility, in 2010 we launched the New Growth Path framework and identified our job drivers as infrastructure development, tourism, agriculture, mining, manufacturing and the green economy.  "
"3971",2012,"Zuma","We declared 2011 the year of job creation, and mobilised our social partners, namely business, labour and the community sector, to work with us in implementing the New Growth Path.  "
"3972",2012,"Zuma","The results are encouraging, although we are not out of the woods yet, given the global economic situation.  "
"3973",2012,"Zuma","The fourth quarter figures released on Tuesday, indicate that the rate of unemployment has come down from twenty-five percent to 23.9% as a result of new jobs.  "
"3974",2012,"Zuma","During 2011, a total of 365 000 people were employed. "
"3975",2012,"Zuma","This is the country?"
"3976",2012,"Zuma","s best performance since the recession of 2008.  "
"3977",2012,"Zuma","What is also important is that all the new jobs are in the formal sector of the economy, in sectors such as mining, transport, community services and trade to name a few.  "
"3978",2012,"Zuma","There are two main things that we did right in 2011 which are contributing to this joint success.  "
"3979",2012,"Zuma","Firstly, we mainstreamed job creation in every government entity including state owned enterprises.  "
"3980",2012,"Zuma","Secondly, we strengthened social dialogue and cooperation between government, business and the community sector.  "
"3981",2012,"Zuma","The Accords, signed by government, business and labour on procurement, skills development, basic education, and the green economy, confirm our common purpose and determination to build this country.  "
"3982",2012,"Zuma","Government alone cannot solve the challenges faced by the country, but working together, solutions are possible.  "
"3983",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Let me take this opportunity to report back on the undertakings made in the SONA last year.  "
"3984",2012,"Zuma","The Job Fund which we announced last year began operating in June. "
"3985",2012,"Zuma","Over 2 500 applications were received in the first round. "
"3986",2012,"Zuma","Project allocations of over one billion rand have been committed.  "
"3987",2012,"Zuma","We had also announced 20 billion rand worth of incentives under Section 12(i) of the Income Tax Act, designed to support new industrial projects and manufacturing, and seven projects with an investment value of 8,4 billion rand were approved.  "
"3988",2012,"Zuma","The procurement regulations empowering the Department of Trade and Industry to designate specific industries where local content is prescribed came into effect in December.  "
"3989",2012,"Zuma","The sectors include clothing textiles, canned vegetables, leather and footwear.  "
"3990",2012,"Zuma","Progress has also been made in amalgamating small business institutions, and a new entity will be launched this year.  "
"3991",2012,"Zuma","We had announced 10 billion rand to be set aside by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) for job creation.  "
"3992",2012,"Zuma","To date, about one point five billion rand was approved for 60 companies to promote job creation.  "
"3993",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends,  The mining industry, one of the job drivers in the New Growth Path, plays a critical role in the socio-economic development of the country.  "
"3994",2012,"Zuma","As part of addressing the triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment, government has developed a beneficiation strategy, which seeks to provide opportunities in the downstream part of the minerals sector.  "
"3995",2012,"Zuma","We remain committed to the creation of a favourable and globally competitive mining sector, and to promote the industry to attract investment and achieve both industrial growth and much-needed transformation.  "
"3996",2012,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker,  Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,  The work done last year indicates that if we continue to grow reasonably well, we will begin to write a new story about South Africa?"
"3997",2012,"Zuma","the story of how, working together, we drove back unemployment and reduced economic inequality and poverty.  "
"3998",2012,"Zuma","It is beginning to look possible.  "
"3999",2012,"Zuma","We must not lose this momentum.    "
"4000",2012,"Zuma","For the year 2012 and beyond, we invite the nation to join government in a massive infrastructure development drive.  "
"4001",2012,"Zuma","Baba Somlomo noSihlalo,  Sizoqala umkhankaso omkhulu wokwakha izingqalazizinda ezweni lonke. "
"4002",2012,"Zuma","Lokhu kuzophakamisa izinga lomnotho, futhi kuveze amathuba emisebenzi.  "
"4003",2012,"Zuma","(Mr Speaker and Chairperson  We are going to launch a huge campaign of building the infrastructure nationwide. "
"4004",2012,"Zuma","This will boost the level of economy and create job opportunities.)  "
"4005",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots,  We will use the project management expertise gained during the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup to make this project a success.  "
"4006",2012,"Zuma","The infrastructure plan will be driven and overseen by the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission, (PICC), which was established in September, bringing together Ministers, Premiers and Metro Mayors under the leadership of the President and the Deputy President.   "
"4007",2012,"Zuma","The PICC has identified and developed projects and infrastructure initiatives from state-owned enterprises as well as national, provincial and local government departments.   "
"4008",2012,"Zuma","These have been clustered, sequenced and prioritised into a pipeline of strategic integrated projects.   "
"4009",2012,"Zuma","We have chosen five major geographically-focussed programmes, as well as projects focusing on health and basic education infrastructure, information and communication technologies and regional integration.  "
"4010",2012,"Zuma","The projects are as follows:   Firstly, we plan to develop and integrate rail, road and water infrastructure, centred around two main areas in Limpopo: the Waterberg in the Western part of the province and Steelpoort in the eastern part.  "
"4011",2012,"Zuma","These efforts are intended to unlock the enormous mineral belt of coal, platinum, palladium, chrome and other minerals, in order to facilitate increased mining as well as stepped-up beneficiation of minerals.  "
"4012",2012,"Zuma","Using the developments in Limpopo as a base, we will expand rail transport in Mpumalanga, connecting coalfields to power stations.  "
"4013",2012,"Zuma","This will enable us to decisively shift from road to rail in the transportation of coal, which has caused a deterioration of the roads in Mpumalanga.  "
"4014",2012,"Zuma","The eastern parts of the North West province will also benefit from the greater focus on infrastructure connected to mining and mineral beneficiation.  "
"4015",2012,"Zuma","Secondly, we will improve the movement of goods and economic integration through a Durban-Free State-Gauteng logistics and industrial corridor.  "
"4016",2012,"Zuma","This project is intended to connect the major economic centres of Gauteng and Durban/Pinetown, and at the same time, connect these centres with improved export capacity through our sea-ports.  "
"4017",2012,"Zuma","In this regard, I am pleased to announce the Market Demand Strategy of Transnet, which entails an investment, over the next seven years, of three hundred billion rand in capital projects.  "
"4018",2012,"Zuma","Of this amount, 200 billion rand is allocated to rail projects and the majority of the balance, to projects in the ports.  "
"4019",2012,"Zuma","Amongst the list of planned projects, is the expansion of the Iron Ore Export channel from 60 million tons per annum to 82 million tons per annum.  "
"4020",2012,"Zuma","It also includes various improvements to the Durban-Gauteng Rail corridor and the phased development of a new 16 million tons per annum manganese export channel through the Port of Ngqura in Nelson Mandela Bay.  "
"4021",2012,"Zuma","The Market Demand Strategy will result in the creation of more jobs in the South African economy, as well as increased localization and Black Economic Empowerment. "
"4022",2012,"Zuma","It will also position South Africa as a regional trans-shipment hub for Sub-Saharan Africa and deliver on NEPAD?"
"4023",2012,"Zuma","s regional integration agenda.  "
"4024",2012,"Zuma","We have also been looking at the necessity of reducing port charges, as part of reducing the costs of doing business. "
"4025",2012,"Zuma","The issue of high port charges was one of those raised sharply by the automotive sector in Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage during my performance monitoring visit to the sector last year.  "
"4026",2012,"Zuma","In this regard, I am pleased to announce that the Port Regulator and Transnet have agreed to an arrangement which will result in exporters of manufactured goods, receiving a significant decrease in port charges, during the coming year, equal to about 1 billion rand in total.  "
"4027",2012,"Zuma","Thirdly, we will develop a major new South Eastern node that will improve the industrial and agricultural development and export capacity of the Eastern Cape region, and expand the province?"
"4028",2012,"Zuma","s economic and logistics linkages with the Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.  "
"4029",2012,"Zuma","In the former Transkei part of the Eastern Cape, we are committed to building a dam using the Umzimvubu River as the source, in order to expand agricultural production.  "
"4030",2012,"Zuma","In addition, the implementation of the Mthatha revitalization project, which is a Presidential special project, is proceeding very well.  "
"4031",2012,"Zuma","Work is at an advanced stage to improve water, sanitation, electricity, roads, human settlements, airport development and institutional and governance issues.  "
"4032",2012,"Zuma","Fourthly, in the North West, we will expand the roll-out of water, roads, rail and electricity infrastructure. "
"4033",2012,"Zuma","Ten priority roads will be upgraded.  "
"4034",2012,"Zuma","Fifthly, we see enormous potential along the west coast of the country and need to improve infrastructure to unlock this potential.  "
"4035",2012,"Zuma","Our plans include the expansion of the iron-ore rail line between Sishen in Northern Cape and Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape, which will create large numbers of jobs in both provinces.  "
"4036",2012,"Zuma","The iron-ore capacity on the transport-side will increase capacity to 100 million tons per annum.  "
"4037",2012,"Zuma","This will allow for the expansion of iron-ore mining over the next decade to feed the developing world?"
"4038",2012,"Zuma","s growing investment in infrastructure and industrial activities.   "
"4039",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots,  We have also identified critical social infrastructure projects. "
"4040",2012,"Zuma","These include projects aimed at laying the basis for the National Health Insurance system such as the refurbishment of hospitals and nurses? "
"4041",2012,"Zuma","homes.   "
"4042",2012,"Zuma","A total of 300 million rand has been allocated for the preparatory work towards building new universities in Mpumalanga and Northern Cape.  "
"4043",2012,"Zuma","Another infrastructure project with great potential is South Africa?"
"4044",2012,"Zuma","s bid to host the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope in partnership with eight other African countries. "
"4045",2012,"Zuma","The winning bid will be announced next month. "
"4046",2012,"Zuma","We urge you to support the country?"
"4047",2012,"Zuma","s bid.  "
"4048",2012,"Zuma","Lastly, our infrastructure work extends beyond our borders. "
"4049",2012,"Zuma","South Africa champions the North-South Road and Rail Corridor, which is part of the African Union?"
"4050",2012,"Zuma","s NEPAD Presidential Infrastructure Championing initiative [PDF].  "
"4051",2012,"Zuma","Work in this regard, comprises various inter-related projects that cover roads and railways, border crossings, energy and information and communication technologies.  "
"4052",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots,  The massive investment in infrastructure must leave more than just power stations, rail-lines, dams and roads. "
"4053",2012,"Zuma","It must industrialise the country, generate skills and boost much needed job creation.  "
"4054",2012,"Zuma","I will convene a Presidential infrastructure summit to discuss the implementation of the plan with potential investors and social partners.  "
"4055",2012,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker, Honourable Chairperson of the NCOP,   I would now like to discuss matters relating to the extension of basic services, addressing inequalities, peace and security and social cohesion.  "
"4056",2012,"Zuma","I received a lot of valuable correspondence in the run-up to this SONA. "
"4057",2012,"Zuma","Such interaction enables us keep in touch with our people and their needs.  "
"4058",2012,"Zuma","I received an email relating to a housing problem from Mzukisi Mali, a public servant from the Fingo area in Grahamstown. "
"4059",2012,"Zuma","He wrote;  ?"
"4060",2012,"Zuma","In 1994 my income was too high to get an RDP and too low to get a bond, this continued until to date.I have three children and my wife is not working.  ?"
"4061",2012,"Zuma","When I apply for an RDP I am told that I do not qualify and cannot get a bond because I am risky to the banks...??  "
"4062",2012,"Zuma","Fortunately we have gone some way to address the problem facing Mr Mali and many others.   "
"4063",2012,"Zuma","In 2010, we announced a one billion rand guarantee fund to promote access to loans.  "
"4064",2012,"Zuma","We are pleased to report that this fund will start its operations in April, managed by the National Housing Finance Corporation. "
"4065",2012,"Zuma","The scheme will enable the Banks to lend to people who are in a similar situation as Mr Mali.  "
"4066",2012,"Zuma","In addition, from April, people earning between three thousand five hundred rand and R15 000, will be able to obtain a subsidy of up to R83 000 from Provinces, to enable them to obtain housing finance from an accredited Bank.  "
"4067",2012,"Zuma","Ungalilahli ithemba Mr Mali nabaningi abanye, kuzolunga ngenxa yalomxhaso ozotholakala kohulumeni bezifundazwe, kanye nalomshwalense omusha ozokwenza kubelula kumabhange ukuthi aniboleke imali.  "
"4068",2012,"Zuma","(Do not despair Mr Mali, as well as many others, the situation will get better as a result of this funding which will be available from provincial governments as well as the new insurance scheme which will make it easier for the banks to give you loans.)  "
"4069",2012,"Zuma","Compatriots,  There is an ongoing concern from business and communities about high electricity costs.  "
"4070",2012,"Zuma","I have asked Eskom to seek options on how the price increase requirement may be reduced over the next few years, in support of economic growth and job creation and give me proposals for consideration.  "
"4071",2012,"Zuma","We need an electricity price path which will ensure that Eskom and the industry remain financially viable and sustainable, but which remains affordable especially for the poor.  "
"4072",2012,"Zuma","However to achieve sustainability, a pact will be required with all South Africans ? "
"4073",2012,"Zuma","including business, labour, municipalities, communities and all customers and suppliers.  "
"4074",2012,"Zuma","We must save electricity.  "
"4075",2012,"Zuma","For the next two years, until the Medupi and Kusile power stations come into operation, the electricity system will be very tight.  "
"4076",2012,"Zuma","We should all play our part in order to avoid load shedding.  "
"4077",2012,"Zuma","To increase energy capacity we will continue searching for renewable energy sources, especially solar electricity and biofuels as we implement the Green Economy Accord with economic stakeholders.  "

"4080",2012,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  Compatriots,  Government continues to extend access to basic water supply. "
"4081",2012,"Zuma","However, clearly, water access is still a challenge in some areas.  "

"4086",2012,"Zuma","People rely on rain to harvest water.  "
"4087",2012,"Zuma","There are water pipes and machines installed but the problem is said to be pressure to pump water. "
"4088",2012,"Zuma","Could your office kindly assist with the powers that be??.  "
"4089",2012,"Zuma","I have asked the Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs to investigate this matter with a view to finding an urgent solution.  "
"4090",2012,"Zuma","Water expansion has been delayed in some parts of the country due to a lack of infrastructure.This is being attended to. "

"4236",2011,"Zuma","Working together we will achieve much more.  "
"4237",2011,"Zuma","BUILDING A MORE PROSPEROUS SOCIETY Compatriots,   While many South Africans celebrate the delivery of houses, electricity or water, there are yet many others who are still waiting.    "
"4238",2011,"Zuma","The legacy of decades of apartheid underdevelopment and colonial oppression cannot be undone in only 17 years.   "
"4239",2011,"Zuma","But we are forging ahead, determined to achieve our mission of building a better life for all.   "
"4240",2011,"Zuma","And we are doing so with the help of our people. "
"4241",2011,"Zuma","We appreciate the feedback they continue to give us.   "
"4242",2011,"Zuma","Bongokuhle Miya wrote on the Presidency Facebook page that his hometown Umzimkhulu is in an appalling condition, with burst sewerage pipes everywhere, no drainage system and domestic animals that are roaming around town.   "
"4243",2011,"Zuma","He writes: “If the Government, which is doing very well, could just pay much more attention, with a bit of urgency to such areas”. "
"4244",2011,"Zuma","Indeed, we agree service delivery should move faster.  "
"4245",2011,"Zuma","Our interactive government also obtains information from direct contact with our people.   "
"4246",2011,"Zuma","In the past year we have visited many villages, townships and suburbs. "
"4247",2011,"Zuma","Their message is consistent.  "
"4248",2011,"Zuma","They appreciate progress made, request faster delivery and state their commitment to work with government to achieve more.  "
"4249",2011,"Zuma","Given the work that must still be done, we decided in 2009 to focus on five priorities. "
"4250",2011,"Zuma","These are education, health, rural development and agrarian reform, taking forward the fight against crime and creating decent work.    "
"4251",2011,"Zuma","We have done well on these priorities.   "
"4252",2011,"Zuma","However, we are concerned that unemployment and poverty persist despite the economic growth experienced in the past 10 years.   "
"4253",2011,"Zuma","To address these concerns, we have declared 2011 a year of job creation through meaningful economic transformation and inclusive growth. "
"4254",2011,"Zuma","We have introduced a New Growth Path that will guide our work in achieving these goals, working within the premise that the creation of decent work is at the centre of our economic policies.  "
"4255",2011,"Zuma","We urge every sector and every business entity, regardless of size, to focus on job creation. "
"4256",2011,"Zuma","Every contribution counts in this national effort.    "
"4257",2011,"Zuma","I will provide just a broad outline of our programme of action in this address.   "
"4258",2011,"Zuma","Ministers will announce their jobs targets and more specific details per sector, in their forthcoming Budget Vote Speeches.  "
"4259",2011,"Zuma","All government departments will align their programmes with the job creation imperative. "
"4260",2011,"Zuma","The provincial and local government spheres have also been requested to do the same.   "
"4261",2011,"Zuma","The programmes of State Owned Enterprises and development finance institutions should also be more strongly aligned to the job creation agenda.   "
"4262",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  Research has indicated that we can create jobs in six priority areas. "
"4263",2011,"Zuma","These are infrastructure development, agriculture, mining and beneficiation, manufacturing, the green economy and tourism.    "
"4264",2011,"Zuma","We cannot create these jobs alone. "
"4265",2011,"Zuma","We have to work with business, labour and the community constituencies.   "
"4266",2011,"Zuma","Experience shows that we succeed when we work together.   "
"4267",2011,"Zuma","One key example is the work done by the Presidential Framework Response to the International Economic Crisis team, comprising government, business, labour and community sectors.   "
"4268",2011,"Zuma","Amongst the key achievements of the team, South Africa introduced its first ever training layoff scheme to provide alternatives to retrenchments.    "
"4269",2011,"Zuma","Another intervention included financial support for firms in distress, which saved about seven thousand jobs. "
"4270",2011,"Zuma","We thank the team for their sterling work, and look forward to ongoing collaboration.  "
"4271",2011,"Zuma","While looking to the private sector in particular to help us create most of the jobs, government will certainly play its part.   "
"4272",2011,"Zuma","We are pleased to announce the establishment of a jobs fund of 9 billion rand over the next three years to finance new job-creation initiatives.  "
"4273",2011,"Zuma","In addition, the Industrial Development Corporation has set aside R10 billion over the next five years for investment in such economic activities with a high jobs potential.   "
"4274",2011,"Zuma","It is also my pleasure Honourable Members, to announce R20 billion in tax allowances or tax breaks to promote investments, expansions and upgrades in the manufacturing sector.    "
"4275",2011,"Zuma","For a project to qualify, the minimum investment must be R200 million for new projects, and R30 million for expansion and upgrades.   "
"4276",2011,"Zuma","The programme will provide an allowance of up to R900 million in tax deductible allowances rand for new investors and R550 million for upgrades and expansions.   "
"4277",2011,"Zuma","Compatriots,  The small business sector is a critical component of the job creation drive.   "
"4278",2011,"Zuma","We will continue to provide financial and non-financial support to small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs), small scale agriculture as well as cooperatives.  "
"4279",2011,"Zuma","We need to cut administrative costs, avoid duplication and direct more resources to small business.   "
"4280",2011,"Zuma","We are therefore considering merging the three agencies Khula, the SA Micro-Finance Apex Fund and the IDC’s small business funding into a single unit.  "
"4281",2011,"Zuma","The campaign to pay SMMEs on time, within 30 days, is proceeding well.  "
"4282",2011,"Zuma","The Department of Trade and Industry payment hotline received about 20 000 calls in the last financial year, and the value of payments facilitated was R210 million.   "
"4283",2011,"Zuma","Other departments have launched their own initiatives, for example the Re Ya Patala (We Pay) initiative of the Department of Public Works.   "
"4284",2011,"Zuma","We are continuing with legislative reforms to make it easier to register businesses and also to strengthen the Competition Act to open the market to new participants.  "
"4285",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Members,   The mineral wealth of our country is a national asset and a common heritage that belongs to all South Africans, with the State as the custodian.  "
"4286",2011,"Zuma","South Africa has significant mining assets, currently valued at 2.5 trillion US dollars.  "
"4287",2011,"Zuma","By 2009, the mining industry contributed more than thirty percent to the country’s total export revenue, and employed 2.9% of the country’s economically active population.  "
"4288",2011,"Zuma","Estimates suggest that our mineral resources are expected to be exploitable for over a century to come.  "
"4289",2011,"Zuma","To take advantage of that potential, government has endorsed the African Exploration, Mining and Finance Corporation as the State Owned Mining Company, that will undertake the mining of minerals of strategic significance.   "
"4290",2011,"Zuma","One of government’s priorities this year is also to finalise and adopt the beneficiation strategy as the official policy of government, so that we can start reaping the full benefits of our commodities.  "
"4291",2011,"Zuma","Compatriots,  In communications, we have committed to convert our television and radio signals from the analogue platform to the more advanced digital signal which will enable quality pictures and sound.   "
"4292",2011,"Zuma","Jobs will be created in manufacturing, packaging, distribution and installation during this period.    "
"4293",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and National Chairperson, We are pleased with the success of our tourism sector, especially given that sixteen tourists create one job in our country.   "
"4294",2011,"Zuma","More than 7, 3 million tourists arrived in South Africa last year, as compared to about 6.3 million in 2009. "
"4295",2011,"Zuma","For further growth, we will strengthen existing markets while exploring the emerging economies.  "
"4296",2011,"Zuma","Our country also continues to be a popular destination for international gatherings.    "
"4297",2011,"Zuma","In July, we will host a high level sports gathering in Durban, the 123rd International Olympic Committee General Assembly Session.   "
"4298",2011,"Zuma","We thank the IOC for the opportunity to host this important congress.  "
"4299",2011,"Zuma","We have already secured ninety five meetings and conferences between 2010 and 2016.    "
"4300",2011,"Zuma","To further boost our tourism potential, we will amongst other measures, look into flexible visa requirements, improved landing slots at foreign airports as well as improved tourism infrastructure.    "
"4301",2011,"Zuma","Linked to tourism, we will continue to develop the cultural industries sector, which contributes about R2 billion to the Gross Domestic Product.    "
"4302",2011,"Zuma","We have also seen the value of events such as the Cape Town International Jazz Festival which, contributed more than R475 million to the economy of Cape Town and created 2 000 jobs in 2010.    "
"4303",2011,"Zuma","We also wish to extend a special mention to the popular Cape Minstrels Carnival, which brightens up this city every year on the 2nd of January, celebrating the freeing of slaves.   "
"4304",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Members, Our infrastructure development programme enables us to expand access to basic services and to improve the quality of life.    "
"4305",2011,"Zuma","This includes projects for the provision of water, electricity and housing.   "
"4306",2011,"Zuma","Energy security is critical for economic development and job creation.  "
"4307",2011,"Zuma","To ensure the security of electricity supply for the country, Eskom has invested more than R75 billion, mainly on the new stations Medupi, Kusile and Ingula, as well as the return to service and transmission of other projects.   "
"4308",2011,"Zuma","We must all save energy so that we do not have to resort to load shedding again as a saving measure.   "
"4309",2011,"Zuma","This year we will start procuring power from Renewable Energy Power Producers, which will demonstrate our commitment to renewable energy.  "
"4310",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  The construction industry is a known driver for work opportunities. "
"4311",2011,"Zuma","There are 1.2 million households living in the country’s 2 700 informal settlements.   "
"4312",2011,"Zuma","By the year 2014, 400 000 of the said households should have security of tenure and access to basic services.    "
"4313",2011,"Zuma","We will also improve the delivery of rental accommodation as some people coming to urban areas do not intend to settle permanently.    "
"4314",2011,"Zuma","This should be welcome news to citizens such as Portia Busisiwe Mrwetyana who wrote on our Facebook page about inequalities in Bekkersdal, where an informal settlement which has no services, lies alongside a suburb across the road with all amenities.  "
"4315",2011,"Zuma","She asks: “What I wanna know is why treat us differently, but we give you the same vote, WHY?”. "
"4316",2011,"Zuma","Government will spend R2,6 billion on water services this year. "
"4317",2011,"Zuma","Among the priority areas are the provinces of Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape where there are still high numbers of people without safe drinking water, while not neglecting other areas.  "
"4318",2011,"Zuma","We noted the requests from many contributors to this address, for government to fix potholes.   "
"4319",2011,"Zuma","Our Expanded Public Works Programme aims to create 4, 5 million work opportunities, and more than a million opportunities have been created already since the beginning of Phase 2.  "
"4320",2011,"Zuma","Part of the programme focuses on repairing our roads networks.   "
"4321",2011,"Zuma","Abantu abaningi bakithi bathola ukusizakala kakhulu ngaloluhlelo lwamatoho emisebenzi kahulumeni.   "
"4322",2011,"Zuma","Kutholakala amatoho okulungisa imigwaqo, ezemidlalo, ukufundisa abadala ukufunda nokubhala, ukugcina imigqwaqo ihlanzekile.    "

"4327",2011,"Zuma","These projects will enhance food security and create work opportunities for many, especially women in rural areas.  "
"4328",2011,"Zuma","To enhance our innovation in science and technology and create jobs, we are bidding to host the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope.   "
"4329",2011,"Zuma","The bid has already provided 800 construction job opportunities in the Northern Cape and will create a further 100 jobs this year.   "
"4330",2011,"Zuma","Our job creation drive should also enhance youth development.   "
"4331",2011,"Zuma","The National Youth Development agency is in discussion with state organs and the private sector to mainstream youth development in public sector programmes and to promote youth enterprises and cooperatives.   "
"4332",2011,"Zuma","Compatriots, We believe that the interventions we have mentioned briefly will take us forward in placing job creation high on the agenda of all decision makers in the country.    "
"4333",2011,"Zuma","Seven Ministers met with our social partners on Tuesday to discuss this partnership and we remain optimistic that we are poised for success.  "
"4334",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,  Parallel to the job creation incentives, we will also undertake policy reforms related to improving the lives of our workers.   "
"4335",2011,"Zuma","Government, with its social partners, is reviewing legislation on labour brokers and the policy framework for the provision of public employment services.   "

"4343",2011,"Zuma","Please allow me to now tackle the other four priorities as well as other programmes.   "
"4344",2011,"Zuma","The focus in basic education this year is Triple T: Teachers, Textbooks and Time. "
"4345",2011,"Zuma","We reiterate our call that teachers must be at school, in class, on time, teaching for at least seven hours a day.   "
"4346",2011,"Zuma","The administration must ensure that every child has a textbook on time, and that we assist our teachers to create the right working environment for quality teaching to take place.  "
"4347",2011,"Zuma","To track progress, this year, we began the annual national assessments in literacy and numeracy that are internationally benchmarked, for grades 3, 6 and 9.   "
"4348",2011,"Zuma","We will continue investing in teacher training, especially in mathematics and science.   "
"4349",2011,"Zuma","We will pay special attention to the training of principals, particularly those in underperforming schools. "

"4361",2011,"Zuma","My visit to a drug rehabilitation centre in Mitchells Plain on Tuesday convinced me that we need more energy in the fight against drug abuse and drug peddling in our communities. "
"4362",2011,"Zuma","I have directed our police force to deal decisively with people who sell drugs to children in Cape Town and other areas.  "

"4427",2011,"Zuma","We will launch a programme celebrating National Icons and promote a National Heritage Route, to honour individuals who have made an enormous contribution to the liberation of our country.   "
"4428",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  We have seen the power of sport as a unifying and nation building tool in our country.   "
"4429",2011,"Zuma","All of us must support the Proteas who will soon be playing in the 2011 ICC World Cup, and the Springboks who will travel to New Zealand to defend our 2007 Rugby World Cup Title.   "
"4430",2011,"Zuma","We also wish the national netball team well when they compete in the Netball World Cup in July. "
"4431",2011,"Zuma","We will be fully behind them.  "
"4432",2011,"Zuma","Let me take this opportunity to salute one of our finest cricketers, Makhaya Ntini who is our special guest this evening. "
"4433",2011,"Zuma","He has made an enormous contribution to local and international cricket.  "
"4434",2011,"Zuma","South Africa will have its third post-apartheid census in October this year.  "
"4435",2011,"Zuma","We thank Mr Makhaya Ntini for agreeing to become an ambassador of this important campaign.    "
"4436",2011,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Honourable Chairperson,  We remain committed to building a performance-orientated State.   "
"4437",2011,"Zuma","Our performance monitoring and evaluation department will coordinate and monitor the work of government departments closely, as they mainstream job creation.  "
"4438",2011,"Zuma","We welcome the undertaking by Parliament to also monitor the adherence to the call to prioritise job creation by government.   "
"4439",2011,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Our goal is clear. "
"4440",2011,"Zuma","We want to have a country where millions more South Africans have decent employment opportunities, which has a modern infrastructure and a vibrant economy and where the quality of life is high.  "
"4441",2011,"Zuma","We all have a responsibility to work hard to make this a reality.   "
"4442",2011,"Zuma","Everyone must think of how they can contribute to the jobs campaign through creating opportunities for themselves and others.   "
"4443",2011,"Zuma","In doing so, we should draw inspiration from our beloved President Mandela in his inauguration address in 1994, reminding us of the need to work together.  "
"4444",2011,"Zuma","He said: “We understand it still, that there is no easy road to freedom.  "
"4445",2011,"Zuma","We know it well, that none of us acting alone can achieve success.  "
"4446",2011,"Zuma","We must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world.  "
"4447",2011,"Zuma","Let there be justice for all.  "
"4448",2011,"Zuma","Let there be peace for all.  "
"4449",2011,"Zuma","Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.  "
"4450",2011,"Zuma","Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfill themselves”.   "
"4451",2011,"Zuma","I thank you."
"4452",2010,"Zuma"," Honorouble Speaker;  I stand before you this evening, 20 years since President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked out of prison.  "
"4453",2010,"Zuma","We have chosen this as the day to call this Joint Sitting of Parliament to deliver the State of the Nation Address, to celebrate a watershed moment that changed our country.  "
"4454",2010,"Zuma","The release of Madiba was brought about by the resolute struggles of the South African people. "
"4455",2010,"Zuma","Former political prisoners and veterans who are with us here witnessed that because they were part of that process.  "
"4456",2010,"Zuma","You will off course recall that the masses of this country, in their different formations, responded with determination to the call to make the country ungovernable and apartheid unworkable. "
"4457",2010,"Zuma","We are celebrating this day with former political prisoners who we have specially invited to join us. "
"4458",2010,"Zuma","We welcome in particular those who have travelled from abroad to be here, Helene Pastoors, Michael Dingake from Botswana, Mr Andimba Toivo ya Toivo of Swapo in Namibia. "
"4459",2010,"Zuma","We are pleased to be joined by members of the legal team in the Rivonia Treason trial – Lord Joel Joffe, who is now based in London and Judge Arthur Chaskalson.  "
"4460",2010,"Zuma","We also remember and pay tribute to Mr Harry Schwarz, who sadly passed away last week. "
"4461",2010,"Zuma","He was, among other things, a member of the Rivonia defence team. "
"4462",2010,"Zuma","We extend our gratitude to our friends and comrades in the international community, for fighting side by side with us to achieve freedom. "
"4463",2010,"Zuma","We extend a special welcome to the Mandela family. "
"4464",2010,"Zuma","They became a symbol of the sacrifices of many who bore the brunt of apartheid. "
"4465",2010,"Zuma","We greet the leadership of the ruling party and Alliance partners, for whom this is an extra special occasion.  "
"4466",2010,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends,  On this special day, we must also acknowledge the contribution of those within the leadership of the National Party, who eventually realised that apartheid had no future. "
"4467",2010,"Zuma","Allow me to mention the role played by former President PW Botha. "
"4468",2010,"Zuma","It was he who initiated the discussion about the possibility of the release of political prisoners. "
"4469",2010,"Zuma","President Botha worked with the former Minister of Justice, Mr Kobie Coetzee, who was in turn assisted by Dr Neil Barnard and Mr Mike Louw. "
"4470",2010,"Zuma","They played a significant role in the process leading to the release of Madiba.  "
"4471",2010,"Zuma","Honourable compatriots,  South Africa is yet to acknowledge in full, the critical role played by the former President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Tambo, who laid the foundation for this country to become a shining example of freedom and democracy.  "
"4472",2010,"Zuma","It was his outstanding leadership, foresight and clarity of vision that led the ANC to intensify the pursuit of a negotiated settlement. "
"4473",2010,"Zuma","His wisdom was also displayed in the Harare Declaration, which he wrote and championed. "
"4474",2010,"Zuma","It was this that laid the groundwork for the historic announcements by President FW de Klerk, 20 years ago.  "
"4475",2010,"Zuma","In this, President de Klerk demonstrated great courage and decisive leadership. "
"4476",2010,"Zuma","On this great day, let me also acknowledge the role played by the late Ms Helen Suzman. "
"4477",2010,"Zuma","She was for a long time, a lone voice in Parliament, calling for change. "
"4478",2010,"Zuma","We also recognise the role of the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who also called for Madiba’s release, as well as that of other political prisoners and the return of exiles.  "
"4479",2010,"Zuma","We reiterate our heartfelt gratitude to the international community for its unwavering support to our struggle. "
"4480",2010,"Zuma","These moments in our history demonstrate our ability to come together, even under the most difficult of circumstances, and to put the country’s interests first above all other interests.  "
"4481",2010,"Zuma","Deur saam te werk, kan ons meer bereik.  "
"4482",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  During the course of this year, we will mark the centenary of the establishment of the Union of South Africa, which was established in 1910. "
"4483",2010,"Zuma","This created a unitary state. "
"4484",2010,"Zuma","Significantly, the exclusion of black people from this Union was one of the chief reasons for the formation of the African National Congress in 1912. "
"4485",2010,"Zuma","As we mark this centenary later in the year, we should reflect on how far we have travelled as a country.  "
"4486",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  We recall the words of Madiba on his release, when he said and I quote:  ""I stand before you, not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people.  "
"4487",2010,"Zuma","Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today.  "
"4488",2010,"Zuma","I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands.""  "
"4489",2010,"Zuma","These words inspire us not to rest until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation. "
"4490",2010,"Zuma","In the two decades since the release of Madiba, our country has changed fundamentally. "
"4491",2010,"Zuma","President Mandela united this country behind the goal of a non-sexist, non-racial, democratic and prosperous South Africa. "
"4492",2010,"Zuma","As we celebrate Madiba’s release today, let us recommit ourselves to building a better future for all South Africans, black and white. "
"4493",2010,"Zuma","Let us pursue the ideal for which Madiba has fought his entire life – the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. "
"4494",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  We called a joint sitting in the evening so that the majority in our country, workers and schoolchildren, can be part of the occasion. "
"4495",2010,"Zuma","We are impressed by the enthusiasm of the youth about the occasion. "
"4496",2010,"Zuma","Two hundred and sixty six children from all provinces participated in the pre-State of the Nation debate on the role of the youth in the fight against poverty.  "
"4497",2010,"Zuma","We congratulate the overall winner, Charlotte Le Fleur of Worcester Secondary School, and all the participants for the hard work.  "
"4498",2010,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends,  We are meeting against the backdrop of a global economic crisis. "
"4499",2010,"Zuma","Last year, we experienced our first recession in 17 years. "
"4500",2010,"Zuma","The crisis cost our economy about 900 000 jobs. "
"4501",2010,"Zuma","Many of those who lost their jobs were the breadwinners in poor families.  "
"4502",2010,"Zuma","In February last year, government, business, labour and community representatives agreed on a package of measures to reduce the scale and impact of the crisis. "
"4503",2010,"Zuma","We have put many of these measures in place. "
"4504",2010,"Zuma","We have implemented decisive anti-recession spending by government, especially on infrastructure. "
"4505",2010,"Zuma","To ensure a safety cushion for the poor, we brought social grant increases forward, and extended the Child-Support Grant to children over 14 years of age. "
"4506",2010,"Zuma","In the next three years, an additional two million children from poor families and households, aged 15 to 18 years, will benefit from the Child-Support Grant.  "
"4507",2010,"Zuma","The Industrial Development Corporation has put aside R6 billion to help companies in distress. "
"4508",2010,"Zuma","Government introduced a “training lay-off scheme” to allow workers the option of a period of training instead of retrenchment. "
"4509",2010,"Zuma","These efforts were enhanced by our Public Works Programme.  "
"4510",2010,"Zuma","The nation will recall that during the 2009 State of the Nation Address, I announced that the Expanded Public Works Programme would create 500 000 work opportunities by December 2009.  "
"4511",2010,"Zuma","These are job opportunities created to provide unemployed people with an income, work experience and training opportunities.  "
"4512",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members, Fellow South Africans,  We are pleased to announce that by the end of December, we had created more than 480 000 public works job opportunities, which is 97% of the target we had set. "
"4513",2010,"Zuma","The jobs are in areas like construction, home and community-based care, and environmental projects. "
"4514",2010,"Zuma","We have identified some areas of improvement, which we will effect going forward, including ensuring more labour-intensive projects. "
"4515",2010,"Zuma","We know that these and other measures cannot fully mitigate the effects of the recession. "
"4516",2010,"Zuma","We are grateful for the spirit of family, community and voluntary work that inspires many people to help those most affected by the crisis, through these difficult times.  "
"4517",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  Economic indicators suggest that we are now turning the corner. "
"4518",2010,"Zuma","Economic activity is rising in South Africa, and we expect growth going forward. "
"4519",2010,"Zuma","The labour statistics released on Tuesday, show that the economy is now creating jobs rather than shedding them. "
"4520",2010,"Zuma","It is too soon, though, to be certain of the pace of recovery. "
"4521",2010,"Zuma","Government will therefore not withdraw its support measures. "
"4522",2010,"Zuma","Now is the time to lay the groundwork for stronger growth going forward, and for growth that gives rise to more jobs.  "
"4523",2010,"Zuma","Our long-term infrastructure programme will help us grow faster. "
"4524",2010,"Zuma","Our education and skills programmes will increase our productivity and competitiveness.  "
"4525",2010,"Zuma","Our Industrial Policy Action Plan and our new focus on green jobs, will build stronger and more labour-absorbing industries. "
"4526",2010,"Zuma","Our rural development programme will improve rural productivity, and the lives of people living in rural areas. "
"4527",2010,"Zuma","Underpinning our strategy for economic recovery and growth, is our capital investment programme.  "
"4528",2010,"Zuma","Over the next three years, government will spend R846 billion on public infrastructure. "
"4529",2010,"Zuma","On transport, we will maintain and expand our road network. "
"4530",2010,"Zuma","We will ensure that our rail network is reliable, competitive and better integrated with our sea ports. "
"4531",2010,"Zuma","To ensure reliable power supply, we have established an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Energy, to develop a 20-year integrated resource plan.  "
"4532",2010,"Zuma","Among other things, this will look at the participation of independent power producers, and protecting the poor from rising electricity prices. "
"4533",2010,"Zuma","We will establish an independent system operator, separate from Eskom Holdings. "
"4534",2010,"Zuma","Eskom will continue to build additional generation capacity and improve the maintenance of its power stations. "
"4535",2010,"Zuma","To ensure the promotion of an inclusive economy, to aid growth and development, we have established the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council, chaired by the President.  "
"4536",2010,"Zuma","The most urgent focus of policy change must be interventions to create jobs for young people. "
"4537",2010,"Zuma","Unemployment rates for young people are substantially higher than the average. "
"4538",2010,"Zuma","Proposals will be tabled to subsidise the cost of hiring younger workers, to encourage firms to take on inexperienced staff. "
"4539",2010,"Zuma","A further expansionof public employment programmes is also underway. "
"4540",2010,"Zuma","This includes local infrastructure and tertiary projects and literacy projects, home-based care, school maintenance and early childhood development initiatives.  "
"4541",2010,"Zuma","Last year we launched the National Youth Development Agency. "
"4542",2010,"Zuma","We have directed the agency to work faster to establish its structures, throughout the country, so that it can assist us to mainstream youth development programmes within government.  "
"4543",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  When this administration came into office last year, we undertook to work harder to build a strong developmental state. "
"4544",2010,"Zuma","We said it would be a state that responds to the needs and aspirations of the people, and which performs better and faster. "
"4545",2010,"Zuma","This year, 2010, shall be a year of action. "
"4546",2010,"Zuma","The defining feature of this administration will be that it knows where people live, understands their needs and responds faster. "
"4547",2010,"Zuma","Government must work faster, harder and smarter.  "
"4548",2010,"Zuma","We will expect the Executive and the Public Service to comply with this vision. "
"4549",2010,"Zuma","We are building a performance-oriented state, by improving planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation. "
"4550",2010,"Zuma","We also need to integrate gender equity measures into the Government’s Programme of Action. "
"4551",2010,"Zuma","This action will ensure that women, children and persons with disabilities can access developmental opportunities.  "
"4552",2010,"Zuma","We are pleased to announce a new way of doing things in government.  "
"4553",2010,"Zuma","The work of departments will be measured by outcomes, developed through our performance monitoring and evaluation system. "
"4554",2010,"Zuma","The ministers who are responsible for a particular outcome, will sign a detailed delivery agreement with the President. "
"4555",2010,"Zuma","It will outline what is to be done, how, by whom, within what time period and using what measurements and resources.  "
"4556",2010,"Zuma","As you are aware, we are committed to five priorities: education, health, rural development and land reform, creating decent work, and fighting crime. "
"4557",2010,"Zuma","In addition, we will work to improve the effectiveness of local government, infrastructure development and human settlements. "
"4558",2010,"Zuma","We will undertake a number of key activities towards the achievement of these outcomes.  "
"4559",2010,"Zuma","We have placed education and skills development at the centre of this government’s policies. "
"4560",2010,"Zuma","In our 2010 programme, we want to improve the ability of our children to read, write and count in the foundation years. "
"4561",2010,"Zuma","Unless we do this, we will not improve the quality of education. "
"4562",2010,"Zuma","Our education targets are simple but critical. "
"4563",2010,"Zuma","We want learners and teachers to be in school, in class, on time, learning and teaching for seven hours a day.  "
"4564",2010,"Zuma","We will assist teachers by providing detailed daily lesson plans. "
"4565",2010,"Zuma","To students, we will provide easy-to-use workbooks in all 11 languages. "
"4566",2010,"Zuma","From this year onwards, all grade 3, 6 and 9 students will write literacy and numeracy tests that are independently moderated. "
"4567",2010,"Zuma","We aim to increase the pass rate for these tests from the current average of between 35 and 40% to at least 60% by 2014. "
"4568",2010,"Zuma","Results will be sent to parents to track progress.  "
"4569",2010,"Zuma","In addition, each of our 27 000 schools will be assessed by officials from the Department of Basic Education. "
"4570",2010,"Zuma","This will be recorded in an auditable written report. "
"4571",2010,"Zuma","We aim to increase the number of matric students who are eligible for university admission to 175 000 a year by 2014.  "
"4572",2010,"Zuma","We urge parents to cooperate with us in making this a success. "
"4573",2010,"Zuma","We welcome last month’s statement by the three teacher unions, NAPTOSA, SADTU and SAOU, reaffirming their commitment to the Quality Learning and Teaching Campaign from the beginning of 2010.  "
"4574",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  We need to invest in our youth to ensure a skilled and capable workforce to support growth and job creation.  "
"4575",2010,"Zuma","We therefore plan to increase the training of 16-25 year olds in further education and training facilities. "
"4576",2010,"Zuma","This will enable us to provide a second chance at education, for those who do not qualify for university. "
"4577",2010,"Zuma","We are working with higher education institutions to ensure that eligible students obtain financial assistance, through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. "
"4578",2010,"Zuma","We have also set ambitious targets for skills development, to produce additional engineers and technicians, and to increase the number of qualified Mathematics and Science teachers. "
"4579",2010,"Zuma","We must also increase the number of youth who enter learnerships in the privateand public sectors.  "
"4580",2010,"Zuma","Another key outcome is to ensure a long and healthy life for all South Africans. "
"4581",2010,"Zuma","We will continue to improve our healthcare system. "
"4582",2010,"Zuma","This includes building and upgrading hospitals and clinics, and further improving the working conditions of healthcare workers. "
"4583",2010,"Zuma","We have partnered with the Development Bank of Southern Africa to improve the functionality of public hospitals and their district offices. "
"4584",2010,"Zuma","We are also collaborating with the DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation, in a public-private partnership programme to improve hospitals and provide finance for projects.  "
"4585",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  We must confront the fact that life expectancy at birth, has dropped from 60 years in 1994 to just below 50 years today. "
"4586",2010,"Zuma","We are therefore making interventions to lower maternal mortality rates, to reduce new HIV infections and to effectively treat HIV and tuberculosis. "
"4587",2010,"Zuma","We will also reduce infant mortality through the massive immunisation programme. "
"4588",2010,"Zuma","We will reinstate health programmes in schools. "
"4589",2010,"Zuma","We will implement all the undertakings made on World AIDS Day relating to new HIV prevention and treatment measures. "
"4590",2010,"Zuma","Intensive work is underway to ensure that this work is on schedule. "
"4591",2010,"Zuma","We will also continue preparations for the establishment of a national health insurance system.  "
"4592",2010,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,  We are working hard to ensure that everyone in South Africa feels safe and is safe. "
"4593",2010,"Zuma","We will take further our work to reduce serious and violent crimes, and ensure that the justice system works efficiently. "
"4594",2010,"Zuma","We are implementing plans to increase the number of policemen and women by 10% over the next three years. "
"4595",2010,"Zuma","We have identified the fight against hijacking, business and house robberies, as well as contact crimes such as murder, rape and assault, as top priorities. "
"4596",2010,"Zuma","We all have a role to play. "
"4597",2010,"Zuma","Let us participate in community safety forums. "
"4598",2010,"Zuma","Let us stop buying stolen goods. "
"4599",2010,"Zuma","Let us always be ready to provide the police with information about criminal activity.  "
"4600",2010,"Zuma","Tshebedisano mmoho etla lwantsha botloko-tsebe.  "
"4601",2010,"Zuma","Compatriots and esteemed guests,  Local government must work. "
"4602",2010,"Zuma","Municipalities must improve the provision of housing, water, sanitation, electricity, waste management and roads. "
"4603",2010,"Zuma","We held a meeting with mayors and municipal managers last year. "
"4604",2010,"Zuma","This provided valuable insight into the challenges in local government. "
"4605",2010,"Zuma","We also visited various communities and municipalities, including Balfour in Mpumalanga and Thembisa in Gauteng. "
"4606",2010,"Zuma","After the Balfour visit, we sent a nine-member ministerial team to visit the area to address the issues that had been raised by the community. "
"4607",2010,"Zuma","A number of issues have already received attention. "
"4608",2010,"Zuma","I have directed the ministers to attend to the outstanding matters. "
"4609",2010,"Zuma","We reiterate that there are no grievances that can justify violence and the destruction of property. "
"4610",2010,"Zuma","We have directed law-enforcement agencies to take a tougher stance on lawlessness in Balfour and other areas. "
"4611",2010,"Zuma","In December 2009, Cabinet approved a turnaround strategy for local government. "
"4612",2010,"Zuma","This will ensure that local government has the correct management, administrative and technical skills.  "
"4613",2010,"Zuma","During this year of action, let us work together to make local government everybody’s business. "
"4614",2010,"Zuma","We are working to upgrade well-located informal settlements and provide proper service and land tenure to at least 500 000 households by 2014. "
"4615",2010,"Zuma","We plan to set aside over 6 000 hectares of well-located public land for low-income and affordable housing.  "
"4616",2010,"Zuma","A key new initiative will be to accommodate people whose salaries are too high to get government subsidies, but who earn too little to qualify for a normal bank mortgage. "
"4617",2010,"Zuma","We will set up a guarantee fund of R1 billion to incentivise the private banking and housing sector, to develop new products to meet this housing demand.  "
"4618",2010,"Zuma","Bakwethu,  Ngonyaka odlule sathi, abantu basemakhaya nabo banelungelo lokuba nogesi, amanzi, izindlu zangasese ezigijima amanzi nemigwaqo.  "
"4619",2010,"Zuma","Sathi kufanele babe nezindawo zezemidlalo kanye nezindawo zokuthenga ezinkulukazi eziphucuzekile njengasemadolobheni.  "
"4620",2010,"Zuma","In this regard, we launched the first pilot site of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme in Giyani, Limpopo, in August last year. "
"4621",2010,"Zuma","Since then, 231 houses have been built. "
"4622",2010,"Zuma","Progress has also been made in providing infrastructure to support agricultural development, and training for community members. "
"4623",2010,"Zuma","Access to health and education facilities has improved. "
"4624",2010,"Zuma","We are implementing similar programmes in seven sites across the country, benefiting 21 wards. "
"4625",2010,"Zuma","By 2014, we aim to have sites in 160 wards. "
"4626",2010,"Zuma","We want 60% of households in these sites to meet their food requirements from own production by 2014.  "
"4627",2010,"Zuma","Kancane kancane kuze kulunge, phela bakwethu, kuthiwa nempandla iqala ngenhlonhlo.  "
"4628",2010,"Zuma","We also need to better integrate land reform and agricultural support programmes. "
"4629",2010,"Zuma","Our success in this area will be measured by the increase in the number of small-scale farmers that become economically viable.  "
"4630",2010,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson of the NCOP,  We are not a water-rich country. "
"4631",2010,"Zuma","Yet, we still lose a lot of water through leaking pipes and inadequate infrastructure. "
"4632",2010,"Zuma","We will be putting in place measures to reduce our water loss by half by 2014.  "
"4633",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  As part of our efforts to encourage greater economic growth, we are working to reduce the cost to communicate. "
"4634",2010,"Zuma","The South African public can look forward to an even further reduction of broadband, cellphone, landline and public phone rates. "
"4635",2010,"Zuma","We will work to increase broadband speed and ensure a high standard of Internet service, in line with international norms.  "
"4636",2010,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,  This government will ensure that our environmental assets and natural resources are well protected, and are continually enhanced.  "
"4637",2010,"Zuma","Together with Brazil, India and China, and joined by the United States, which represented the developed world, we made a significant contribution to the accord adopted at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit in December last year. "
"4638",2010,"Zuma","Although it does not go as far as required, it is an important step forward as it commits all countries to respond to climate change. "
"4639",2010,"Zuma","We will work harder with our international counterparts towards a legally binding treaty. "
"4640",2010,"Zuma","As South Africa, we have voluntarily committed ourselves to specific emission-reduction targets, and will continue working on our long-term climate change mitigation strategy.  "
"4641",2010,"Zuma","Honourable members,  We will intensify efforts to promote the interests of South Africa globally. "

"4645",2010,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,  The Public Service has to respond to the call to make this term one of faster action and improved state performance. "
"4646",2010,"Zuma","We require excellence and hard work. "
"4647",2010,"Zuma","We need public servants who are dedicated, capable and who care for the needs of citizens. "
"4648",2010,"Zuma","Government is already working on the development and implementation of a public service development programme, which will set the norms and standards for public servants in all spheres.  "
"4649",2010,"Zuma","Honourable Members,  We continue our efforts to eradicate corruption and fraud in procurement and tender processes, and in applications for drivers’ licences, social grants and identity documents, among others. "
"4650",2010,"Zuma","We are pleased with the progress government is making in some areas. "
"4651",2010,"Zuma","This week, we terminated 32 687 fraudulent social grants payments, valued at R180 million. "
"4652",2010,"Zuma","Our Inter-Ministerial Committee on Corruption is looking at ways to decisively defeat corruption.  "
"4653",2010,"Zuma","Nga u shumisana rothe ringa bveledza zwinzhi.  "
"4654",2010,"Zuma","Compatriots,  As you are aware, we introduced the Presidential Hotline to make government and The Presidency more accessible to the public, and to help unblock service-delivery blockages. "
"4655",2010,"Zuma","The hotline represents our determination to do things differently in government. "
"4656",2010,"Zuma","It has made a difference in the lives of many South Africans. "
"4657",2010,"Zuma","We can mention Mrs Buziwe Ngaleka of Mount Frere, whose call about her late husband’s pension was the first we took on the first day of the service. "

"4659",2010,"Zuma","We also have among us Mr Nkululeko Cele, who was helped to obtain identity documents, which allowed him to enrol at Tshwane University of Technology.  "
"4660",2010,"Zuma","These are just two among many success stories. "
"4661",2010,"Zuma","From these and other examples, we identify weaknesses that should be rectified by various spheres of government. "
"4662",2010,"Zuma","Through the Speaker, we have invited a multiparty delegation from Parliament to visit the call centre, so that MPs can get a first-hand account of the work done.  "
"4663",2010,"Zuma","Compatriots and friends,  I have outlined the main elements of our plans for 2010, our collective commitment as government to the people of South Africa. "

"4681",2010,"Zuma","Compatriots, let us also stand behind the national team Bafana Bafana. "

"4685",2010,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,  As we celebrate Madiba’s release today, we recommit ourselves to reconciliation, national unity, non-racialism and building a better future together as South Africans, black and white.  "
"4686",2010,"Zuma","We are guided by what Madiba said in the dock, that and I quote:  ""During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people.  "
"4687",2010,"Zuma","I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.  "
"4688",2010,"Zuma","I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony, and with equal opportunities.  "
"4689",2010,"Zuma","It is an ideal which I hope to live for, and to achieve.  "
"4690",2010,"Zuma","But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""  "
"4691",2010,"Zuma","Inspired by our icon Madiba, it is my honour to dedicate this 2010 State of the Nation Address to all our heroes and heroines, sung and unsung, known and unknown. "
"4692",2010,"Zuma","Let us work together to make this year of action a successful one for our country.  "
"4693",2010,"Zuma","I thank you."
"4694",2009,"Zuma"," Honourable Speaker; Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; Deputy President of the Republic, Kgalema Motlanthe Former President of the Republic, Thabo Mbeki, Our icon, the First President of a democratic South Africa, Isithwalandwe Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, Former Deputy Presidents, Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces; Esteemed members of the Judiciary; Chairperson of SALGA, mayors and leaders in our system of local government; Chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders and our honoured traditional leaders; Heads of Chapter 9 Institutions; Governor of the Reserve Bank, Religious leaders, Directors-General and other leaders of the public service; President of the Pan African Parliament, Honourable Idriss Endele Moussa, Your Excellencies Ambassadors and High Commissioners; Distinguished guests, comrades and friends;  Fellow South Africans,  Dumelang, Avuxeni, Molweni,  On the 22nd of April, millions of South Africans went out to cast their votes. "
"4695",2009,"Zuma","They exercised their democratic right spurred on by the desire to change their lives for the better.  "
"4696",2009,"Zuma","In their overwhelming numbers, they confirmed that working together we can do more to fight poverty and build a better life for all.  "
"4697",2009,"Zuma","They were encouraged by the vision of an inclusive society, a South Africa that belongs to all, a nation united in its diversity, a people working together for the greater good of all.  "
"4698",2009,"Zuma","We are humbled by this decisive electoral mandate given by the people of our country, who have chosen their government in a most convincing manner.  "
"4699",2009,"Zuma","Honourable members,  Our nation has over the past few years gone through very challenging times.  "
"4700",2009,"Zuma","It is thanks to the fact that we have a strong and fully functional constitutional democratic system, with solid institutions, that we overcame these difficulties smoothly and with dignity.  "
"4701",2009,"Zuma","Today’s occasion is a celebration of what makes this democracy work. "
"4702",2009,"Zuma","It is also a celebration of our culture of continuity and collective responsibility.  "
"4703",2009,"Zuma","This is evidenced by the presence here of our icon Madiba, who laid the foundation for the country’s achievements, and that of former President Thabo Mbeki, who built on that foundation.  "
"4704",2009,"Zuma","The continuity is also evident in the fact that former President Kgalema Motlanthe is now the Deputy President of the Republic, after a seamless transition, making us a unique country in many respects.  "
"4705",2009,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,  As you would be aware, the fight against poverty remains the cornerstone of our government’s focus.  "
"4706",2009,"Zuma","On the 9th of May, during the Presidential inauguration, we made a commitment to our people and the world that:  “For as long as there are South Africans who die from preventable disease;  For as long as there are workers who struggle to feed their families and who battle to find work;  For as long as there are communities without clean water, decent shelter or proper sanitation;  For as long as there are rural dwellers unable to make a decent living from the land on which they live;  For as long as there are women who are subjected to discrimination, exploitation or abuse;  For as long as there are children who do not have the means nor the opportunity to receive a decent education;  We shall not rest, and we dare not falter, in our drive to eradicate poverty.  "
"4707",2009,"Zuma","In pursuit of these goals, our government has identified 10 priority areas, which form part of our Medium Term Strategic Framework for 2009 to 2014.  "
"4708",2009,"Zuma","The programme is being introduced under difficult economic conditions.  "
"4709",2009,"Zuma","The past year has seen the global economy enter a period of crisis unprecedented in recent decades.  "
"4710",2009,"Zuma","While South Africa has not been affected to the extent that a number of other countries have, its effects are now being clearly seen in our economy. "
"4711",2009,"Zuma","We have entered a recession.  "
"4712",2009,"Zuma","It is more important now than ever that we work in partnership on a common programme to respond to this crisis.  "
"4713",2009,"Zuma","We take as our starting point the framework for South Africa's response to the international economic crisis, concluded by government, labour and business in February this year. "
"4714",2009,"Zuma","We must act now to minimise the impact of this downturn on those most vulnerable.  "
"4715",2009,"Zuma","We have begun to act to reduce job losses. "
"4716",2009,"Zuma","There is an agreement in principle between government and the social partners on the introduction of a training layoff.  "
"4717",2009,"Zuma","Workers who would ordinarily be facing retrenchment due to economic difficulty would be kept in employment, for a period of time and  re-skilled.  "
"4718",2009,"Zuma","Discussion on the practical detail is continuing between the social partners and the institutions that would be affected by such an initiative, including the Sector Education and Training Authorities.  "
"4719",2009,"Zuma","We will support the work of the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to assist employers and workers to find alternatives to retrenchments through the relevant legal process.  "
"4720",2009,"Zuma","To date, CCMA commissioners have saved over four thousand jobs through facilitation processes, and provided ongoing advice and support to retrenched workers.  "
"4721",2009,"Zuma","The Industrial Development Corporation has developed a programme to fund companies in distress. "
"4722",2009,"Zuma","We will also ensure that government buys more goods and services locally, without undermining our global competitiveness or pushing up costs beyond acceptable levels.  "
"4723",2009,"Zuma","Building on the successes of our industrial policy interventions, a scaled up Industrial Policy Action Plan will be developed.  "
"4724",2009,"Zuma","The lead sectors already identified are automobile, chemicals, metal fabrication, tourism, clothing and textiles as well as forestry. "
"4725",2009,"Zuma","In addition, attention will also be paid to services, light manufacturing and construction amongst others, in the quest to create decent jobs.  "
"4726",2009,"Zuma","As part of Phase 2 of the Expanded Public Works Programme, the Community Work Programme will be fast-tracked.  "
"4727",2009,"Zuma","It offers a minimum level of regular work to those who need it, while improving the quality of life in communities.  "
"4728",2009,"Zuma","The economic downturn will affect the pace at which our country is able to address the social and economic challenges it faces. "
"4729",2009,"Zuma","But it will not alter the direction of our development.  "
"4730",2009,"Zuma","The policy priorities that we have identified, and the plans that we placed before the electorate, remain at the core of the programme of this government.  "
"4731",2009,"Zuma","Laat ons mekaar se hande vat, en saam oplossings vind in die gees van ’n Suid Afrikaanse gemeenskap. "
"4732",2009,"Zuma","Die tyd het gekom om harder te werk.  "
"4733",2009,"Zuma","Ons regering gaan vorentoe kyk, nie agtertoe nie!    "
"4734",2009,"Zuma","[English version: In the spirit of a South African community, let us join our hands to find solutions together. "
"4735",2009,"Zuma","The time has come to work harder.  "
"4736",2009,"Zuma","Our government will look forward, not backward!]  "
"4737",2009,"Zuma","The steps outlined in our Medium Term Strategic Framework had to take into account the constraints posed by the economic crisis. "
"4738",2009,"Zuma","The downturn should not cause us to change these plans. "
"4739",2009,"Zuma","Instead it should urge us to implement these with speed and determination.  "
"4740",2009,"Zuma","The Framework focuses on 10 priorities.  "
"4741",2009,"Zuma","We make a commitment that working together we will speed up economic growth and transform the economy to create decent work and sustainable livelihoods.  "
"4742",2009,"Zuma","We will introduce a massive programme to build economic and social infrastructure. "
"4743",2009,"Zuma","We will develop and implement a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land and agrarian reform and food security.  "
"4744",2009,"Zuma","We will strengthen the skills and human resource base. "
"4745",2009,"Zuma","We will improve the health profile of all South Africans.  "
"4746",2009,"Zuma","Working together with all South Africans, we will intensify the fight against crime and corruption. "
"4747",2009,"Zuma","We will build cohesive, caring and sustainable communities.  "
"4748",2009,"Zuma","Working with Africa and the rest of the world, we will pursue African advancement and enhanced international co-operation.  "
"4749",2009,"Zuma","We will ensure sustainable resource management and use.  "
"4750",2009,"Zuma","And, working with the people and supported by our public servants, we will build a developmental state, improve public services and strengthen democratic institutions.  "
"4751",2009,"Zuma","It is my pleasure and honour to highlight the key elements of our programme of action.  "
"4752",2009,"Zuma","The creation of decent work will be at the centre of our economic policies and will influence our investment attraction and job-creation initiatives.  "
"4753",2009,"Zuma","In line with our undertakings, we have to forge ahead to promote a more inclusive economy.  "
"4754",2009,"Zuma","In this regard, we will utilise state levers such as procurement, licensing and financial support to assist small medium enterprises as well as to promote the implementation of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment and affirmative action policies.  "
"4755",2009,"Zuma","The implementation will be done in recognition of the need to correct the imbalances of the past.  "
"4756",2009,"Zuma","The transformation will be undertaken in support of women, youth and people with disabilities.  "
"4757",2009,"Zuma","We will reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses. "
"4758",2009,"Zuma","The matter of being stifled by regulations has been raised by the sector several times.  "
"4759",2009,"Zuma","In another intervention to create an enabling environment for investment, government will move towards a single integrated business registration system.  "
"4760",2009,"Zuma","This will improve customer service and reduce the cost of doing business in South Africa.    "
"4761",2009,"Zuma","Another important element of our drive to create job opportunities is the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP). "
"4762",2009,"Zuma","The initial target of one million jobs has been achieved.  "
"4763",2009,"Zuma","The second phase of the programme aims to create about four million job opportunities by 2014.  "
"4764",2009,"Zuma","Between now and December 2009, we plan to create about 500 000 job opportunities.  "
"4765",2009,"Zuma","While creating an environment for jobs and business opportunities, government recognises that some citizens will continue to require state social assistance. "
"4766",2009,"Zuma","Social grants remain the most effective form of poverty alleviation. "
"4767",2009,"Zuma","As of 31 March 2009, more than 13 million people received social grants, more than 8 million of whom are children.  "
"4768",2009,"Zuma","We are mindful of the need to link the social grants to jobs or economic activity in order to encourage self-reliance amongst the able-bodied.  "
"4769",2009,"Zuma","Most importantly during this period, neighbours should assist each other.  "
"4770",2009,"Zuma","Jwale ke nako ya kopano. "
"4771",2009,"Zuma","Ha re thusaneng jwaloka baahisane.  "
"4772",2009,"Zuma","A re dumellane hore ho se ke ha eba le ngwana ya tla robala ka tlala hobane batswadi ba hae ba feletswe ke mosebetsi. "
"4773",2009,"Zuma","Ha re ka kopana ra ba ra sebetsa mmoho, re ka etsa haholwanyane.  "
"4774",2009,"Zuma","[English version:  Now is the time for unity. "
"4775",2009,"Zuma","Let us help each other like neighbours.  "
"4776",2009,"Zuma","Let us agree that there should be no child who will go to bed with a hungry stomach just because his/her parents are unemployed. "
"4777",2009,"Zuma","If we can unite and work together, we can do more.]  "
"4778",2009,"Zuma","Distinguished guests, as part of the second strategic priority we will continue with our programme to build economic and social infrastructure.  "
"4779",2009,"Zuma","The newly-formed Infrastructure Development Cluster of government will ensure that the planned R787 billion infrastructure expenditure as provided for in the budget earlier this year is properly planned for and executed.  "
"4780",2009,"Zuma","This funding includes allocations for the school building programme, public transport including the bus rapid transit system, housing, water and sanitation.  "
"4781",2009,"Zuma","One of the biggest infrastructure investment projects is in the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup. "
"4782",2009,"Zuma","We have, as government and the nation at large, pledged that the World Cup will leave a proud legacy from which Our children and our communities will benefit for many years to come.  "
"4783",2009,"Zuma","We are on track to meet all our obligations and are determined to give the world the best World Cup ever.  "
"4784",2009,"Zuma","We are putting all systems in place to make the Confederations Cup, which kicks off on the 14th of June, a huge success.  "
"4785",2009,"Zuma","In April this year, I gave an undertaking to the taxi industry leadership to defer negotiations relating to the operation of the Bus Integrated Rapid Transit system until after the elections.  "
"4786",2009,"Zuma","We undertook to allow more time to deal properly with the concerns of the industry. "
"4787",2009,"Zuma","On the 11th of June the Minister of Transport will resume discussions with the industry.  "
"4788",2009,"Zuma","The meeting will kick-start a series of engagements with the stakeholders affected by the BRT system. "
"4789",2009,"Zuma","We are confident that unresolved issues will be dealt with to the satisfaction of all parties.  "
"4790",2009,"Zuma","This will include the important issue of how all stakeholders will benefit from the initiative.  "
"4791",2009,"Zuma","Honourable members,  Another development which should boost the World Cup is the roll-out of the digital broadcasting infrastructure and signal distribution transmitters.  "
"4792",2009,"Zuma","Overall, we will ensure that the cost of telecommunications is reduced through the projects under way to expand broadband capacity.  "
"4793",2009,"Zuma","We have to ensure that we do not leave rural areas behind in these exciting developments.  "
"4794",2009,"Zuma","As part of social infrastructure development we will provide suitably located and affordable housing and decent human settlements.  "
"4795",2009,"Zuma","We will proceed from the understanding that human settlement is not just about building houses.    "
"4796",2009,"Zuma","It is about transforming our cities and towns and building cohesive, sustainable and caring communities with closer access to work and social amenities, including sports and recreation facilities.  "
"4797",2009,"Zuma","In this spirit, we will work with Parliament to speed up the processing of the Land Use Management Bill.  "
"4798",2009,"Zuma","Working together with our people in the rural areas, we will ensure a comprehensive rural development strategy linked to land and agrarian reform and food security, as our third priority.  "
"4799",2009,"Zuma","I would like to use this opportunity to extend our condolences to the family of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Dirk du Toit, who passed away this week. "
"4800",2009,"Zuma","His contribution will be sorely missed.  "
"4801",2009,"Zuma","Abantu basemakhaya nabo banelungelo lokuba nogesi namanzi, izindlu zangasese ezigijima amanzi, imigwaqo, izindawo zokuqeda isizungu nezemidlalo kanye nezindawo zokuthenga eziphucukile njengasemadolobheni.  "
"4802",2009,"Zuma","Nabo banelungelo lokusizwa kwezolimo ukuze bazitshalele imifino nokunye, bafuye nemfuyo bakwazi ukuziphilisa.  "
"4803",2009,"Zuma","Sizimisele ukuwuqala lomkhankaso wokwakha izingqalasizinda ezindaweni zasemakhaya. "
"4804",2009,"Zuma","Uma sibambisene nezakhamizi, amakhosi, amakhansela nezinduna siyokwazi ukuwusheshisa lomsebenzi. "
"4805",2009,"Zuma","Sicela abahlala ezindaweni zasemakhaya baqale balungiselele ukutshela uhulumeni ukuthi yiziphi izinto abazidinga ngokushesha.  "
"4806",2009,"Zuma","Uma sisebenza ngokubambisana sizokwenza okuningi.    "
"4807",2009,"Zuma","[English version: People in the rural areas also have a right to electricity and water, flush toilets, roads, entertainment and sport centres; as well as better shopping centres like those in the cities.  "
"4808",2009,"Zuma","They too have a right to be helped in farming so that they can grow vegetables and other things; and raise livestock so that they can feed themselves.  "
"4809",2009,"Zuma","We are prepared to start this campaign of building infrastructures in rural areas. "
"4810",2009,"Zuma","Working together with communities, chiefs, councillors and headmen we will be able to speed up this work.  "
"4811",2009,"Zuma","We urge people in the rural areas to start preparing to tell us about the things that they need urgently. "
"4812",2009,"Zuma","Working together we can do more.]  "
"4813",2009,"Zuma","Hon. "
"4814",2009,"Zuma","Speaker and Chairperson,  While having drawn the necessary lessons from earlier rural development initiatives, we have chosen the Greater Giyani Local Municipality in Limpopo as the first of the pilot projects for the campaign. "
"4815",2009,"Zuma","Out of these projects will emerge lessons for the whole country.  "
"4816",2009,"Zuma","In addition, we will work on the targeted renewal of rural towns, through grants such as the Neighbourhood Development Grant programme. "
"4817",2009,"Zuma","In this way, areas around the towns will benefit from the economic boost.  "
"4818",2009,"Zuma","With all these interventions, we are poised to change the face of rural areas in our country.  "
"4819",2009,"Zuma","Compatriots,  Education will be a key priority for the next five years. "
"4820",2009,"Zuma","We want our teachers, learners and parents to work with government to turn our schools into thriving centres of excellence.  "
"4821",2009,"Zuma","The Early Childhood Development programme will be stepped up, with the aim of ensuring universal access to Grade R and doubling the number of 0-4 year old children by 2014.  "
"4822",2009,"Zuma","We reiterate our non-negotiables. "
"4823",2009,"Zuma","Teachers should be in school, in class, on time, teaching, with no neglect of duty and no abuse of pupils! "
"4824",2009,"Zuma","The children should be in class, on time, learning, be respectful of their teachers and each other, and do their homework.  "
"4825",2009,"Zuma","To improve school management, formal training will be a pre-condition for promoting teachers to become principals or heads of department.  "
"4826",2009,"Zuma","I will meet school principals to share our vision on the revival of our education system.  "
"4827",2009,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,    We will increase our efforts to encourage all pupils to complete their secondary education.  "
"4828",2009,"Zuma","The target is to increase enrolment rates in secondary schools to 95 per cent by 2014. "
"4829",2009,"Zuma","We are also looking at innovative measures to bring back into the system pupils who dropped out of school, and to provide support.  "
"4830",2009,"Zuma","Honourable members, we are very concerned about reports of teachers who sexually harass and abuse children, particularly girls.  "
"4831",2009,"Zuma","We will ensure that the Guidelines on Sexual Harassment and Violence in Public Schools are widely disseminated, and that learners and teachers are familiar with and observe them.  "
"4832",2009,"Zuma","We will take very serious, and very decisive, action against any teachers who abuse their authority and power by entering into sexual relationships with children.  "
"4833",2009,"Zuma","To promote lifelong learning, the Adult Basic Education and Training Kha ri Gude programme will be intensified.  "
"4834",2009,"Zuma","Compatriots, honourable members,  We have to ensure that training and skills development initiatives in the country respond to the requirements of the economy.  "
"4835",2009,"Zuma","The Further Education and Training sector with its 50 colleges and 160 campuses nationally will be the primary site for skills development training.  "
"4836",2009,"Zuma","We will improve the access to higher education of children from poor families and ensure a sustainable funding structure for universities.  "
"4837",2009,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans,    We are seriously concerned about the deterioration of the quality of health care, aggravated by the steady increase in the burden of disease in the past decade and a half.  "
"4838",2009,"Zuma","We have set ourselves the goals of further reducing inequalities in health care provision, to boost human resource capacity, revitalise hospitals and clinics and step up the fight against the scourge of HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and other diseases.  "
"4839",2009,"Zuma","We must work together to improve the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan for the Treatment, Management and Care of HIV and AIDS so as to reduce the rate of new HIV infections by 50% by the year 2011. "
"4840",2009,"Zuma","We want to reach 80% of those in need of ARV treatment also by 2011.  "
"4841",2009,"Zuma","We will introduce a National Health Insurance scheme in a phased and incremental manner. "
"4842",2009,"Zuma","In order to initiate the NHI, the urgent rehabilitation of public hospitals will be undertaken through Public-Private Partnerships.  "
"4843",2009,"Zuma","We are also paying urgent attention to the issues of remuneration of health professionals to remove uncertainty in our health services.  "
"4844",2009,"Zuma","Working together let us do more to promote quality health care, in line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to halve poverty by 2014.    "
"4845",2009,"Zuma","Fellow citizens,  Together we must do more to fight crime. "
"4846",2009,"Zuma","Our aim is to establish a transformed, integrated, modernised, properly-resourced and well-managed criminal justice system.  "
"4847",2009,"Zuma","It is also critically important to improve the efficiency of the courts and the performance of prosecutors and to enhance detective, forensic and intelligence services. "
"4848",2009,"Zuma","This work has started in earnest, and it will be undertaken with new energy and vigour.  "
"4849",2009,"Zuma","Among the immediate targets is to ensure that we increase the number of prosecutors and Legal Aid Board personnel. "
"4850",2009,"Zuma","We will do the same with police detectives.  "
"4851",2009,"Zuma","We changed the name of the relevant Ministry from Safety and Security to Police to emphasise that we want real operational energy in police work. "
"4852",2009,"Zuma","This will contribute to the reduction of serious and violent crimes by the set target of 7% to 10% per annum.  "
"4853",2009,"Zuma","The most serious attention will also be given to combating organised crime, as well as crimes against women and children.  "
"4854",2009,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,  While appreciating the investment of the private sector in the security industry, we will improve the regulation of this industry.  "
"4855",2009,"Zuma","Amongst other key initiatives, we will start the process of setting up a Border Management Agency; we shall intensify our efforts against cyber crime and identity theft, and improve systems in our jails to reduce repeat offending.  "
"4856",2009,"Zuma","Compatriots,  I wish to underline our support for the continued transformation of the judiciary.  "
"4857",2009,"Zuma","The transformation should address key issues such as the enhancement of judicial independence, entrenching internal systems of judicial accountability as well as ensuring full access to justice by all.  "
"4858",2009,"Zuma","The success of the democratic system as a whole depends on good relations of mutual respect and a spirit of partnership among the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. "
"4859",2009,"Zuma","This is very important for our constitutional democracy.  "
"4860",2009,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,  We have repeatedly stated our commitment to fight corruption in the public service.  "
"4861",2009,"Zuma","We will pay particular attention to combating corruption and fraud in procurement and tender processes, application for drivers’ licences, social grants, identity documents (IDs), and theft of police case dockets.  "
"4862",2009,"Zuma","Let me emphasise that we all have a role to play in this war against crime.  "
"4863",2009,"Zuma","We must actively participate in Community Policing Forums. "
"4864",2009,"Zuma","We must stop buying stolen goods, which encourages crime.  "
"4865",2009,"Zuma","We must report crime and assist the police with information to catch wrongdoers. "
"4866",2009,"Zuma","In this way, we will move forward towards a crime-free society.  "
"4867",2009,"Zuma","Honourable Members, since 1994 we have sought to create a united cohesive society out of our fragmented past. "
"4868",2009,"Zuma","We are called upon to continue this mission of promoting unity in diversity and to develop a shared value system, based on the spirit of community solidarity and a caring society.  "
"4869",2009,"Zuma","Our shared value system should encourage us to become active citizens in the renewal of our country. "
"4870",2009,"Zuma","We must build a common national identity and patriotism.  "
"4871",2009,"Zuma","We must develop a common attachment to our country, our Constitution and the national symbols. "
"4872",2009,"Zuma","In this spirit, we will promote the National Anthem and our country’s flag and all other national symbols.  "
"4873",2009,"Zuma","Our children, from an early age, must be taught to pay allegiance to the Constitution and the national symbols, and know what it means to be South African citizens.  "
"4874",2009,"Zuma","We will ensure a common national approach to the changing of geographic and place names. "
"4875",2009,"Zuma","This must provide an opportunity to involve all South Africans in forging an inclusive national identity, to deepen our understanding of our history and heritage.  "
"4876",2009,"Zuma","Sport is a powerful nation-building tool. "
"4877",2009,"Zuma","Working together we must support all our national teams from Bafana Bafana to the Proteas and the Springboks; from Banyana Banyana to Paralympians.  "
"4878",2009,"Zuma","Our teams can only do well with our support.  "
"4879",2009,"Zuma","Allow me to use this opportunity to congratulate our national teams for their performances in the past week, indeed in pulling off a hat trick.  "
"4880",2009,"Zuma","The country’s women’s netball team has done us proud by winning the Tri-Nations Netball Challenge. "
"4881",2009,"Zuma","Congratulations to the Sevens Springboks who have become the IRB Sevens World Series Champions - and not forgetting the Blue Bulls who have won the Super 14 finals in a convincing fashion!  "
"4882",2009,"Zuma","We take this opportunity to wish the Springboks well in the upcoming series against the British and Irish Lions.  "
"4883",2009,"Zuma","It is clear that we need to invest on a large scale in sports development. "
"4884",2009,"Zuma","We will speed up the revival of school sport and ensure that it forms part of the school curriculum. "
"4885",2009,"Zuma","In addition we will ensure that the provision of sport facilities in poorer communities receives priority.  "
"4886",2009,"Zuma","Hon. "
"4887",2009,"Zuma","Speaker and Chairperson,    We have committed ourselves over the years to contribute to building a better Africa and a better world.  "
"4888",2009,"Zuma","The main goal of government for the medium term is to ensure that our foreign relations contribute to the creation of an environment conducive to sustainable economic growth and development.  "
"4889",2009,"Zuma","To this effect, we will continue to prioritise the African continent by strengthening the African Union and its structures, and give special focus to the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.  "
"4890",2009,"Zuma","Equally important, and closer to home, is the strengthening of regional integration with particular emphasis on improving the political and economic integration of SADC, towards the AU goal of a Union government. "
"4891",2009,"Zuma","We will establish a South African Development Partnership Agency to promote developmental partnerships with other countries on the continent.  "
"4892",2009,"Zuma","South Africa will continue to assist in the reconstruction and development of the African continent especially in post-conflict situations. "
"4893",2009,"Zuma","We will continue to encourage a peaceful and sustainable settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two- state solution.  "
"4894",2009,"Zuma","We will support the peace efforts of the African Union and the United Nations on the African continent, including in the Saharawi Arab Republic and Darfur in Sudan.  "
"4895",2009,"Zuma","As the Chairperson of SADC and Facilitator, we will participate in promoting inclusive government until free and fair elections are held in Zimbabwe.  "
"4896",2009,"Zuma","The plight of the Zimbabwean people has had a negative impact on the SADC region, especially South Africa. "
"4897",2009,"Zuma","We call upon all peace-loving countries in the world to support the inclusive government to achieve economic recovery.  "
"4898",2009,"Zuma","We will support efforts of the SADC region to resolve the situation in Madagascar.  "
"4899",2009,"Zuma","Allow me, distinguished guests, to pay tribute to the SA National Defence Force for their sterling role in peace building in the continent.  "
"4900",2009,"Zuma","Through continental and regional bodies, we will work towards the entrenchment of democracy and the respect for human rights on the African continent.  "
"4901",2009,"Zuma","We will contribute to the strengthening of South-South relations and pursue mutually beneficial agreements with key countries of the South.  "
"4902",2009,"Zuma","We will continue to enhance relations with the developed North including the G8, and our strategic partnership with the European Union.  "
"4903",2009,"Zuma","We will continue to play an active role in ensuring the conclusion of the WTO Doha Development round of negotiations.  "
"4904",2009,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,    South Africa, being a dry country requires urgent action to mitigate adverse environmental changes and to ensure the provision of water to citizens.  "
"4905",2009,"Zuma","Amongst various programmes, we will implement the Water for Growth and Development strategy, which will strengthen water management. "
"4906",2009,"Zuma","We will continue to improve our energy efficiency and reliance on renewable energy.  "
"4907",2009,"Zuma","Honourable members,    A developmental state requires the improvement of public services and strengthening of democratic institutions.  "
"4908",2009,"Zuma","We have established two Ministries in the Presidency to strengthen both strategic planning as well as performance monitoring and evaluation.  "
"4909",2009,"Zuma","To ensure delivery on our commitments, we will hold Cabinet Ministers accountable through performance instruments, using established targets and output measures, starting in July.  "
"4910",2009,"Zuma","We will also involve State-Owned Enterprises and Development Finance Institutions in the government planning processes and improve the monitoring and evaluation of their performance.  "
"4911",2009,"Zuma","Honourable members, fellow South Africans,  To ensure that all three spheres - local, provincial and national - improve service delivery, we will speed up the establishment of a single Public Service.  "
"4912",2009,"Zuma","This administration will insist on putting people first in service delivery. "
"4913",2009,"Zuma","We will ensure courteous and efficient service from front-counter staff in the provision of services in all government departments.  "
"4914",2009,"Zuma","In this era of renewal, we will move towards a more interactive government.  "
"4915",2009,"Zuma","To lead by example, work has begun on the establishment of a public liaison capacity in the Presidency.  "
"4916",2009,"Zuma","In addition to receiving letters and emails from the public, we will also establish a hotline for easier access.  "
"4917",2009,"Zuma","Staff will handle each public inquiry as if it was the only one, following it through all the channels until it receives the attention it deserves.  "
"4918",2009,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson,  The National Youth Development Agency, formed through the merger of Umsobomvu Youth Fund and the National Youth Commission will be launched on June 16 in Ekurhuleni.  "
"4919",2009,"Zuma","The institutions are being merged to enhance service and development opportunities provided to the youth.  "
"4920",2009,"Zuma","The Agency will link up unemployed young graduates with economic opportunities; strengthen efforts to expand the National Youth Service Programme and support young entrepreneurs.  "
"4921",2009,"Zuma","Speaker and Chairperson, distinguished guests,  Next month our beloved Madiba will turn 91. "
"4922",2009,"Zuma","People all over the world still continue to clamour for his presence and for him to address their crises.  "
"4923",2009,"Zuma","His values and his example of dedication to the service of humanity is a shining example in today’s troubled world.  "
"4924",2009,"Zuma","An international campaign has been initiated by the Nelson Mandela Foundation and related organisations, called Mandela Day, which sums up what Tata stands for.  "
"4925",2009,"Zuma","Mandela Day will be celebrated on the 18th of July each year. "
"4926",2009,"Zuma","It will give people in South Africa and all over the world the opportunity to do something good to help others.  "
"4927",2009,"Zuma","Madiba was politically active for 67 years, and on Mandela Day people all over the world, in the workplace, at home and in schools, will be called upon to spend at least 67 minutes of their time doing something useful within their communities, especially among the less fortunate.  "
"4928",2009,"Zuma","Let us wholeheartedly support Mandela Day and encourage the world to join us in this wonderful campaign.    "
"4929",2009,"Zuma","Honourable Speaker and Chairperson, fellow South Africans,  We have presented to the nation our programme for the next five years. "
"4930",2009,"Zuma","Attached to each commitment we make is a detailed project plan, with targets and critical milestones.  "
"4931",2009,"Zuma","This information will in due course be made public. "
"4932",2009,"Zuma","Indeed as citizens we should at the same time ask ourselves what is it that we can do on our own to help promote this national programme.  "
"4933",2009,"Zuma","To be a citizen is not only about rights, it is also about responsibility, to make a contribution to make ours a better country.  "
"4934",2009,"Zuma","We also expect to work well with Opposition parties in Parliament, in the spirit of putting the country first.  "
"4935",2009,"Zuma","In addition, Madiba taught us well that this country belongs to all, black and white. "
"4936",2009,"Zuma","Working for reconciliation and unity will remain important as we move forward.  "
"4937",2009,"Zuma","Since the implementation of our programme will take place in the face of the economic downturn, we will have to act prudently - no wastage, no rollovers of funds - every cent must be spent wisely and fruitfully. "
"4938",2009,"Zuma","We must cut our cloth according to our size.  "
"4939",2009,"Zuma","Fellow South Africans, working together we can do more to realise our common vision of a better and more prosperous nation!  "
"4940",2009,"Zuma","This is the partnership we are calling for.  "
"4941",2009,"Zuma","I thank you!"
"4942",2009," Motlanthe"," Madam Speaker of the National Assembly; Mr. "
"4943",2009," Motlanthe","Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Madam Deputy President; Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Chief Justice Langa; The former Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and President of the ANC; Premiers of Provinces; Members of Cabinet and Speakers of Provincial Legislatures; The Former Chief Justice and Former Presiding Officers of Parliament; Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners and visiting foreign dignitaries; Honourable Leaders of Political Parties and Members of Parliament, Traditional leaders; Your worship the Mayor of the City of Cape Town; Religious leaders and representatives of civil society; Comrades and friends; Distinguished guests:  I am privileged to address the Joint Sitting of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, at the beginning of this last session of our Third Democratic Parliament.  "
"4944",2009," Motlanthe","I stand before the people of South Africa with humility at the opportunity I have had to occupy the highest office in the land as a consequence of the unique circumstance arising out of the decision of the leading party in government to recall the former President.  "
"4945",2009," Motlanthe","Mine is a responsibility, within a matter of a few months, to lead the National Executive in completing the mandate accorded the African National Congress in the 2004 elections, and in laying the foundation for the post-election administration to hit the ground running.  "
"4946",2009," Motlanthe","That we were able five months ago to ensure a seamless transition and continuity in the systems of government is thanks to the maturity of our constitutional system, reflected in part in the co-operation of members of the Executive – old and new – and the steady hand of our public sector managers.  "
"4947",2009," Motlanthe","As we look back over the past fifteen years, I wish to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and the many women and men who played their role in steering the ship of state under democracy: in the Executive and the administration, the legislatures across the three spheres of government and the Judiciary; driven by the desire to improve the quality of life of all South Africans.  "
"4948",2009," Motlanthe","Above all, I stand before you with pride and confidence that the South Africa we celebrate today – worlds apart from the divisions, conflict and exclusion of a mere 15 years ago – is a product of the labours and toils of South African women and men from all walks of life.  "
"4949",2009," Motlanthe","These South Africans represent the hope and resilience that characterise our nation.  "
"4950",2009," Motlanthe","Within the galaxy of outstanding South Africans are Members of our democratic Parliament to whom we had the misfortune since last February to bid the final farewell. "
"4951",2009," Motlanthe","They include Brian Bunting, Billy Nair, Ncumisa Kondlo, John Gomomo, Joe Nhlanhla, Cas Saloojee, John Schippers and Jan van Eck.  "
"4952",2009," Motlanthe","To these, I would also like to add Ms Helen Suzman, a truly distinguished South African, who represented the values of our new Parliament in the chambers of the old.       "
"4953",2009," Motlanthe","It is these and other patriots who should take the greatest share of the accolade when we pronounce that – whatever economic storms may pound our shores, whatever political uncertainties may visit our collective consciousness in a transition – our nation is in a good state.  "
"4954",2009," Motlanthe","However, we should not underestimate the challenges we face. "
"4955",2009," Motlanthe","The global economic meltdown does pose serious dangers for our economy in terms of job losses and the quality of life of our people.  "
"4956",2009," Motlanthe","Naturally, the uncertainties of a political transition can pose more questions than there are currently answers.  "
"4957",2009," Motlanthe","As a consequence, some of us may be mesmerised by the transient waves of stormy weather and hunch our shoulders in the face of these headwinds of economic turbulence and political tumult.  "
"4958",2009," Motlanthe","But ours is a journey of hope and resilience.  "
"4959",2009," Motlanthe","We may even say that, in a strange quirk of fate, many aspects of our constitutional order have been tested in the recent past; and everyone of them has passed the test to reveal a democracy that is exceptionally resilient.  "
"4960",2009," Motlanthe","Our democracy is healthy. "
"4961",2009," Motlanthe","It is steadily growing stronger, underpinned by a Constitution hardly equalled in the world.  "
"4962",2009," Motlanthe","Indeed, the robustness of our political engagement during this season of electoral contest – which we all agree should be dignified and peaceful – is the surest guarantee of the continued survival and deepening of our democracy.  "
"4963",2009," Motlanthe","It is South Africa’s people who have ensured its progress; and it is they who shall secure our democracy in the years to come.  "
"4964",2009," Motlanthe","Allow me, Madame Speaker and Chairperson, in this context to urge all eligible South Africans to register and to vote in the coming national and provincial elections, so that we can shape our destiny ourselves.  "
"4965",2009," Motlanthe","This we should do every working day in the municipal offices, before the voters’ roll is closed. "
"4966",2009," Motlanthe","But we should also take advantage of the special registration weekend arranged by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (the IEC) tomorrow and Sunday, the 7th and 8th of February respectively.  "
"4967",2009," Motlanthe","I should also take this opportunity to indicate that I will in the next few days conclude consultations with the Electoral Commission and the Provincial Premiers and announce the date of the elections.  "
"4968",2009," Motlanthe","Honourable Members;  We owe our being as a democracy to the people of South Africa who, on 27 April 1994, for the first time collectively took their destiny into their own hands.  "
"4969",2009," Motlanthe","Through that simple but profound act of casting a ballot for a government of all the people of our country, we turned our backs on a past that dehumanised us all.     "
"4970",2009," Motlanthe","It is therefore appropriate on this occasion to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the OAU Ad-hoc Committee on Southern Africa on the Question of South Africa adopted in August, 1989 – commonly known as the Harare Declaration.  "
"4971",2009," Motlanthe","That initiative laid the foundation for global consensus, through the United Nations, on the approach to negotiations in South Africa.  "
"4972",2009," Motlanthe","Within South Africa, it also informed the content of the 1989 Conference for a Democratic Future – bringing together patriots from virtually all walks of life.   "
"4973",2009," Motlanthe","All this led to the negotiations process which culminated in our first democratic elections in 1994.  "
"4974",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, we should salute the late President of the African National Congress, Oliver Reginald Tambo, for initiating and piloting through continental and world bodies what became a compass for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in our country.  "
"4975",2009," Motlanthe","That courageous step to devise a framework that would seek peace and reconciliation, in the place of war and conflict, reversed for good the false dawn of a hundred years ago: that is, the conclusion in 1909 of the National Convention which presaged the formation of the Union of South Africa.  "
"4976",2009," Motlanthe","While that Convention defined the territorial integrity of South Africa as we know it today, it was based on racial oppression and exclusion.  "
"4977",2009," Motlanthe","And so, 15 years into our democracy, we can assert that the fear, the insecurity and the loathing that 100 years ago generated an exclusive and illusory peace among colonial masters, were not only unfounded; but truly misplaced.  "
"4978",2009," Motlanthe","Those fears and insecurities gave rise to decades of resistance. "
"4979",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, we salute that brave son of our people, Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu who went to the gallows 30 years ago with his head held high, in the proud knowledge that his blood would nourish the tree of freedom.  "
"4980",2009," Motlanthe","Allow me to acknowledge Lucas Mahlangu, brother of Kalushi, representing the Mahlangu family.    "
"4981",2009," Motlanthe","Solomon Mahlangu was continuing a tradition of the warriors of yesteryear, among whom we count those under King Cetshwayo who in 1879 defeated the British army in Isandlwana, in defence of the freedom of the indigenous people of our country and the sovereignty of their lands.  "
"4982",2009," Motlanthe","A hundred and thirty (130) years on, we can only marvel at the hope and the resilience that infused those stout hearts.  "
"4983",2009," Motlanthe","In the centres of learning, the same resistance fuelled the rekindling of mass struggles during the cold winter after the banning of the liberation movement and the imprisonment of most of its senior leadership.  "
"4984",2009," Motlanthe","A group of valiant students broke away from NUSAS to found the South African Students’ Organisation (SASO) 40 years ago.  "
"4985",2009," Motlanthe","Within this generation are the early leaders of SASO, which included: Strini Moodley, Professor Barney Pityana, Steve Biko, Onkgopotse Tiro, Harry Nengwekhulu, Themba Sono, Mapetla Mohapi, Mosioua Lekota, Johnny Issel and Mthuli ka Shezi. "
"4986",2009," Motlanthe","For inspiring hope in a period of despair, we salute them. "
"4987",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, we wish to acknowledge Onkgopotse Tiro’s cousin, Pat Tlhagwana.  "
"4988",2009," Motlanthe","In this context we also wish to acknowledge the late Ephraim Mogale, the founding President 30 years ago of the Congress of South African Students (COSAS), and his peers.   "
"4989",2009," Motlanthe","In the towering memory of these students of yesteryear resides an abiding message, that the thirst for freedom and knowledge burns even stronger in the bosoms of our youth.  "
"4990",2009," Motlanthe","The message of their heroic deeds rings true today as it did those many years ago, that we should together expand the frontiers of opportunity; that we should indeed, in the words of the Freedom Charter, open ever wider “the doors of learning and of culture”!  "
"4991",2009," Motlanthe","We call to mind these organisations and leaders to emphasise the spirit of hope and resilience that infused the democratic struggle even when everything looked bleak; to underscore the responsibility that rests on our shoulders to advance the ideals that so many sacrificed for, refusing to be cowed by setbacks and hardships.  "
"4992",2009," Motlanthe","And so, Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson, we should ask ourselves: how have our actions defined the path of South African society’s evolution in the fifteen years since the birth of our democracy; and how have we advanced the cause of human development and human dignity since the 2004 democratic mandate!  "
"4993",2009," Motlanthe","We do have today a well-functioning democratic system, based on principles of transparency and openness, with numerous platforms for public participation and independent institutions mandated by the Constitution to support democracy.  "
"4994",2009," Motlanthe","Over the years, we have steadily improved the structures of governance. "
"4995",2009," Motlanthe","We have built a system of healthy inter-governmental relations across the spheres, and improved integration within and among them.  "
"4996",2009," Motlanthe","Indeed, government can be proud that we have changed the demographic composition of the public service, which in virtually all respects approximates the character of our society.  "
"4997",2009," Motlanthe","However, while women constitute about 34% of all senior positions in the public service, this falls short of the target of parity that we had set ourselves.  "
"4998",2009," Motlanthe","At the level of the national and provincial legislatures, indications are that the nation will this year surpass the 32% women representation level achieved in 2004 and hopefully, even the 40% achieved in the 2006 local government elections.  "
"4999",2009," Motlanthe","We hope that all political parties will, as they finalise their electoral lists, make their contribution to this noble endeavour!  "
"5000",2009," Motlanthe","Though some progress has been made, at 0,2%, the situation is less impressive with regard to people with disability employed in government, measured against the 2% target we set ourselves.  "
"5001",2009," Motlanthe","On both counts, the private sector is lagging far behind.  "
"5002",2009," Motlanthe","Various measures have been put in place to improve the efficiency of the public service, including financial management, Thusong Service Centres and other service delivery innovations, izimbizo and, as currently in the Department of Home Affairs, firm leadership.  "
"5003",2009," Motlanthe","However, much more needs to be done to improve the service culture and orientation of some public servants, especially those at the coal-face of direct interaction with the public.  "
"5004",2009," Motlanthe","As Honourable Members will be aware, our government has made the fight against corruption one of the core areas of focus.  "
"5005",2009," Motlanthe","This is reflected, among others, in legislation, rules and regulations governing public servants and political office-bearers alike, partnerships with civil society and the business community, as well as anti-corruption hotlines.  "
"5006",2009," Motlanthe","It may as well be that the systems of preventing and punishing corruption are still inadequate; but from the point of view of government systems, we can draw solace from the fact that over 70% of cases of corruption reported in the media become public because government has detected the wrongdoing and is in fact acting against it.  "
"5007",2009," Motlanthe","The same challenges confront the private sector. "
"5008",2009," Motlanthe","In the end, the challenge is as much about regulation; as it is about consistent enforcement.  "
"5009",2009," Motlanthe","Honourable Members;  I am certain that we are all agreed that the well-being of our society depends, critically, on the progress we make in expanding the nation’s wealth and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared by the people as a whole.  "
"5010",2009," Motlanthe","It is common cause that, after the economic stagnation of the late 1980s and early 1990s, South Africa has experienced the longest period of sustained economic growth since the recording of such statistics started in 1940.  "
"5011",2009," Motlanthe","In the First Decade of Freedom, economic growth averaged 3% per year, and this improved to 5% per year on average from 2004 to 2007.  "
"5012",2009," Motlanthe","While the consumer boom, impelled by rising employment and incomes and low inflation and interest rates, played its part in this regard, we are encouraged by the broad canvass of opportunities for further expansion going forward.  "
"5013",2009," Motlanthe","These include, in the first instance, higher rates of investment by both the public and private sectors. "
"5014",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, some five years ago, we were hovering around 16% of gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). "
"5015",2009," Motlanthe","Such has been the acceleration in investment that today this figure stands at 22%, closer to the 25% that we projected to attain only in 2014.  "
"5016",2009," Motlanthe","This is in part a consequence of deliberate programmes by government to expand public infrastructure.  "
"5017",2009," Motlanthe","It is also a result of policies to improve the climate for private sector investments; and to conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a manner that expands access to services and reduces the inflationary burden while at the same time ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustainability.  "
"5018",2009," Motlanthe","The focus on micro-economic reforms in the past decade, and the efforts, especially since 2004 more systematically to remove the variety of obstacles to growth have had a positive impact.  "
"5019",2009," Motlanthe","It is in this context that the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative (AsgiSA) is being implemented, ensuring that all the critical blockages such as infrastructure bottlenecks, integrated industrial policy and programmes, the skills challenge, regulatory gridlocks and efficiency of government services are addressed in a focussed and systematic manner.  "
"5020",2009," Motlanthe","Our economy has become more open, and since 1994 it has steadily become integrated into the global system. "
"5021",2009," Motlanthe","Our financial institutions are a force of good example which has somewhat sheltered us from the global economic storms.  "
"5022",2009," Motlanthe","Yet, the extent of their reach within our society remains far below expectations. "
"5023",2009," Motlanthe","Our economy remains largely reliant on mining and agriculture for exports. "
"5024",2009," Motlanthe","Except for the services sector, we have not seen a large enough expansion in critical sectors, especially manufacturing.  "
"5025",2009," Motlanthe","As such, the rate of growth in exports has not been as high as in comparable countries. "
"5026",2009," Motlanthe","It is precisely this weakness which accounts for the large Current Account deficit particularly when we entered higher ranges of growth.  "
"5027",2009," Motlanthe","And because we have a low savings rate, we have had to rely on short-term capital flows to finance the deficit as well as our investment programmes.  "
"5028",2009," Motlanthe","These are challenges that our country will certainly have to address going forward.  "
"5029",2009," Motlanthe","Of critical importance is the question: what in fact should economic growth be about? "
"5030",2009," Motlanthe","Wealth is created in order to improve people’s quality of life.  "
"5031",2009," Motlanthe","Thus, the question whether growth is equitably shared should form a central pillar of all our economic considerations.  "
"5032",2009," Motlanthe","Importantly, sharing the benefits of growth should entail labour-absorption, ensuring that there is decent work.  "
"5033",2009," Motlanthe","Indeed, it is a matter of proud record that between 1995 and 2003, the economy created about one-and-half million net new jobs; and even more remarkable, about 500 000 jobs a year between 2004 and 2007.  "
"5034",2009," Motlanthe","In this latter period, for the first time since the attainment of democracy, more jobs were being created than the number of new entrants into the labour market, thus reducing the unemployment rate from 31% in 2003 to 23% in 2007.  "
"5035",2009," Motlanthe","Of course, this should not detract from our obligation to continue interrogating the issue of the quality of these jobs, including the rights and benefits that workers enjoy.     "
"5036",2009," Motlanthe","Sharing the benefits of growth should also include accelerated implementation of affirmative action, including Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment.  "
"5037",2009," Motlanthe","This is not in pursuit of a so-called racial agenda. "
"5038",2009," Motlanthe","In reality, a country that does not ensure the involvement of all of its population at all levels of economic activity is certainly going to perform well below its actual potential.   "
"5039",2009," Motlanthe","The fact that the private sector lags behind in changing the demographics of management and skilled occupations, in enterprise development and so on in part makes our country a laggard in the high growth stakes.  "
"5040",2009," Motlanthe","Sharing the benefits of growth also means an efficient and equitable role for the state in using the fiscus as an instrument of redistribution and sharing the burden of providing public goods.  "
"5041",2009," Motlanthe","Honourable Members will be familiar with most of the data on matters relating to the social wage. "
"5042",2009," Motlanthe","I will however cite a few instances again to sketch out the nature of the progress we have made and the challenges that we face.  "
"5043",2009," Motlanthe","Government is painfully aware that abject poverty is still too widespread in our society; and the level of inequality is too high.  "
"5044",2009," Motlanthe","We have in the past 15 years done our best to attack this scourge through the social wage. "
"5045",2009," Motlanthe","To quote work conducted by a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch, led by Professor Servaas van der Berg:  “Firstly, money-metric poverty declined substantially since the turn of the century. "
"5046",2009," Motlanthe","The reduction is to a large extent due to a dramatic expansion in social grants expenditure from 2002 onwards. "
"5047",2009," Motlanthe","This improvement is mirrored in access to basic services – a rapid decline in asset poverty even preceded the decline in money-metric poverty. "
"5048",2009," Motlanthe","Secondly, although the reductions in poverty have been substantial, aggregate inequality increased during the 1990s. "
"5049",2009," Motlanthe","Thirdly, the dynamics underlying the poverty and inequality trends determine the broad policy outlook…[P]poverty has decreased since the transition, but … inequality has not improved.”  "
"5050",2009," Motlanthe","(Poverty since the transition: What we know, p8: van der Berg et al, August 2007)  On a critical matter of detail, the researchers further observe:  “…Among households that include children (defined as those aged 17 and younger), the number of households reporting that a child went hungry declined dramatically (from just over 31 per cent to 16 per cent) between 2002 and 2006. "
"5051",2009," Motlanthe","This suggests that the poverty situation has improved remarkably, particularly among people experiencing the greatest degree of welfare deprivation. "
"5052",2009," Motlanthe","The prevalence of hunger among children has virtually halved over four years.” "
"5053",2009," Motlanthe","(Poverty since the transition: What we know, p25: van der Berg et al, August 2007)  Indeed, these observations are confirmed by our own research, which shows that income poverty especially among African and Coloured communities has declined, partly as a result of higher rates of employment and access to social grants. "
"5054",2009," Motlanthe","While the number of grant beneficiaries was 2,5-million in 1999, by 2008 this had increased to 12,4-million.  "
"5055",2009," Motlanthe","This is largely a result of massive expansion in access to the Child Support Grant, which increased from 34-thousand beneficiaries in 1999 to 8,1-million in 2008.  "
"5056",2009," Motlanthe","As part of the contribution to the income of the poor, the target for 1-million work opportunities through the Expanded Public Works Programme was attained in 2008, a year earlier than envisaged in the 2004 electoral mandate. "
"5057",2009," Motlanthe","This has created the possibility massively to expand this programme and improve its quality.  "
"5058",2009," Motlanthe","With regard to household access to basic services, the figures speak for themselves. "
"5059",2009," Motlanthe","For instance, access to potable water has improved from 62% in 1996 to 88% in 2008; electricity (58% to 72%); and sanitation (52% to 73%).  "
"5060",2009," Motlanthe","Evidence of the social wage is also seen in massive improvements in access to primary health facilities. 95% of South Africans now live within 5 kilometres of a health facility; and we are informed that all clinics now have access to potable water. "
"5061",2009," Motlanthe","Child immunisation coverage has steadily increased to about 85%; and malaria cases have massively declined.  "
"5062",2009," Motlanthe","We are also heartened that research into HIV prevalence demonstrates stabilisation and a slight reduction in rates of infection.  "
"5063",2009," Motlanthe","Further, our antiretroviral treatment programme is not only the largest in the world; but it is expanding all the time, with over 690 000 patients having been initiated on antiretroviral treatment since the commencement of the programme.  "
"5064",2009," Motlanthe","Yet many health facilities do not always have the required medicines, appropriate staffing levels, and constant supply of basic services such as clean running water and electricity. "
"5065",2009," Motlanthe","In some of these facilities, management is poor and staff attitudes need improvement.  "
"5066",2009," Motlanthe","In education, we have seen a drop in the educator: learner ratio; almost universal access in terms of enrolment at primary school level; and an improvement in the number of pupils passing mathematics, to quote a few examples.  "
"5067",2009," Motlanthe","At the same time, much effort has been put into improving infrastructure in poor areas.  "
"5068",2009," Motlanthe","Of course we do know that the drop-out rate particularly at secondary and tertiary levels is unacceptably high, and the educational system has yet to produce the requisite kinds of skills needed by society.  "
"5069",2009," Motlanthe","In addition, trends in performance, both in terms of teaching and learning, show a worrying persistence of the social divisions of the past.  "
"5070",2009," Motlanthe","Ironically, precisely where education is most needed to help break the cycle of poverty, is where infrastructure, administrative and teacher capacity are least impressive.    "
"5071",2009," Motlanthe","Government’s social programmes have also improved the asset base of the poor, in the form of housing – with 2,6-million subsidised houses provided.  "
"5072",2009," Motlanthe","We should of course acknowledge that the land redistribution programme as well as post-settlement support could have been handled faster and better.  "
"5073",2009," Motlanthe","Overall, we are proud of the advances in our social programmes. "
"5074",2009," Motlanthe","But we cannot satisfy ourselves merely with quantitative change.  "
"5075",2009," Motlanthe","Be it in education, health, housing, water or sanitation, the central question that confronts us every day is how to improve the quality of these services! "
"5076",2009," Motlanthe","On this we still have some way to go.  "
"5077",2009," Motlanthe","Honourable Members;  The scourge of crime remains a major source of insecurity for South Africans. "
"5078",2009," Motlanthe","Daily experience, in poor and affluent neighbourhoods alike, is one of apprehension at the possibility of violent attack.  "
"5079",2009," Motlanthe","Within public and private institutions, the possibility of nefarious schemes siphoning off resources through corruption is always a source of great concern  Of course, the overall crime rate, having peaked in 2002, has consistently declined. "
"5080",2009," Motlanthe","All kinds of statistics can be cited to attest to this.  "
"5081",2009," Motlanthe","But we do know that the reduction has not been fast enough, not even at the 7-10% rate that we set ourselves for various categories of contact crime. "
"5082",2009," Motlanthe","The fact that incidents of violent robberies in households and businesses have been on the increase; and crimes against women and children have not abated in any significant measure, is a matter of great concern.  "
"5083",2009," Motlanthe","This points to weaknesses in our neighbourhoods, especially in building the bonds of community solidarity that would assist us in preventing and combating crime. "
"5084",2009," Motlanthe","It points to systemic weaknesses in the criminal justice system, from investigation of crimes to rehabilitation of offenders. "
"5085",2009," Motlanthe","It points to weaknesses in the efficiency of the court system, both in terms of technical and other infrastructure and management.  "
"5086",2009," Motlanthe","These are the issues that the comprehensive revamp of the criminal justice system has started to address.    "
"5087",2009," Motlanthe","Yet, in being brutally self-critical, we should not lose sight of the fact that what we are assessing is a system that enjoys, by far, better legitimacy than ever experienced in our country.  "
"5088",2009," Motlanthe","This is because of the transformation these institutions have undergone, in terms of their doctrines based on a human rights culture, their demographic composition, and their systems of accountability.  "
"5089",2009," Motlanthe","But let us not delude ourselves: as with the rest of our social life, such transformation is still at its nascent stages. "
"5090",2009," Motlanthe","We still have a long way to go.  "
"5091",2009," Motlanthe","I am certain that Honourable Members will agree that the humanity of our democratic dispensation should find expression in the extent to which we pay attention to the most vulnerable in society.  "
"5092",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, we have through legislation, international conventions, regulations and campaigns ensured that concrete efforts are made to improve the conditions of children, women, people with disability and the elderly.  "
"5093",2009," Motlanthe","Through advocacy campaigns and indeed as a result of the partnerships we have built with organisations representing these vulnerable groups, we have improved awareness around issues that affect them; and progressively encouraged the mainstreaming of these concerns.  "
"5094",2009," Motlanthe","It is a matter of proud record that, for instance, female-headed households have received a bigger-than-average share of the social wage including housing and health care; and that among the most successful programmes have been campaigns on child immunisation and nutrition.  "
"5095",2009," Motlanthe","Yet access to employment weighs heavily on rural women, youth and people with disability. "
"5096",2009," Motlanthe","HIV impacts most severely on young women. "
"5097",2009," Motlanthe","Violence against women and children is much too high.  "
"5098",2009," Motlanthe","All these are assignments for the coming period.  "
"5099",2009," Motlanthe","Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson;  These then are some of the advances that democracy has brought; and the progress that government has made in fulfilling the mandate of the electorate.  "
"5100",2009," Motlanthe","There is no gainsaying that, by any measure, the progress made since 1994 has been impressive. "
"5101",2009," Motlanthe","But neither can there be doubt that the challenges remain immense.  "
"5102",2009," Motlanthe","It is apt therefore to remind ourselves of that instructive observation of hope and resilience, continuity and change, by former President Nelson Mandela, in his biography, Long Walk to Freedom:  ""I have walked that long road to freedom. "
"5103",2009," Motlanthe","I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. "
"5104",2009," Motlanthe","But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. "
"5105",2009," Motlanthe","I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. "
"5106",2009," Motlanthe","But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.""  "
"5107",2009," Motlanthe","In a few months from now the people of our country will pronounce on the leadership they prefer to carry forward the noble work of this great freedom fighter and other founders of our democracy.  "
"5108",2009," Motlanthe","While our approaches may differ, the objectives that we need to aim for are clearly and unambiguously set out in our Constitution: to create a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society that plays a positive role in building a better world.    "
"5109",2009," Motlanthe","Six years ago, leaders of our people came together in a Growth and Development Summit and reached agreement on the tasks all of us should undertake to improve the quality of life of South Africans, particularly to halve unemployment and poverty by 2014. "
"5110",2009," Motlanthe","These include:  creating more jobs, better jobs and decent work for all through higher rates of investment, public works programmes, sector partnerships and strategies, local procurement, small enterprise promotion and support for co-operatives;  addressing the investment challenge by improving savings, appropriately deploying resources from pension and provident funds, housing, financial sector contributions and black economic empowerment;  advancing equity, developing skills, creating economic opportunities and extending services; and  local action and implementation for development, including provision of infrastructure and access to basic services.  "
"5111",2009," Motlanthe","I am certain, that, as part of and in addition to, these objectives South Africans would hardly differ regarding the need to improve our education system; to provide efficient, decent and equitable health care; to develop our rural areas and ensure food security; and to intensify the fight against crime and corruption.  "
"5112",2009," Motlanthe","I cite these issues not because they are all-encompassing nor that by identifying them we would cure all the ills of our society. "
"5113",2009," Motlanthe","Rather, I have chosen to do so to emphasise the point that South Africa does not suffer the poverty of visions. "
"5114",2009," Motlanthe","Our challenge is to translate these visions into programmes and projects for effective implementation.  "
"5115",2009," Motlanthe","These ideals are shared by virtually all of humanity, as reflected in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  "
"5116",2009," Motlanthe","And yet humanity today faces the danger that the attainment of these objectives could be postponed by many years, if not decades, as a consequence of the economic crisis that has engulfed the global village.  "
"5117",2009," Motlanthe","What, on the surface, started off as a financial crisis among a few lending institutions has exploded into a global credit crunch, with severe consequences for actual production and trade.  "
"5118",2009," Motlanthe","We can decry the greed, the short-termism and the carelessness of managers of big corporations which precipitated the crisis. "
"5119",2009," Motlanthe","We can condemn the policies of governments which took their eyes off the ball and allowed the rapacious licence of unregulated markets to wreak havoc on financial systems. "
"5120",2009," Motlanthe","We can do all this; and we will be perfectly justified.  "
"5121",2009," Motlanthe","Yet our central and immediate task is fully to appreciate the consequences of these developments on our own economy and our region, and devise responses that will minimise their impact especially on the most vulnerable sectors of our society.  "
"5122",2009," Motlanthe","What we do know is that the regulatory environment in our country and the counter-cyclical budget policies we adopted have helped us avoid the worst impact of the crisis.  "
"5123",2009," Motlanthe","But we are all too aware that, because we are strongly integrated into the world economy, demand for our exports has declined; access to finance and inflows of capital have turned for the worse; lower demand has precipitated a scaling down of production; the creation of jobs is negatively affected and in some sectors retrenchment has become a reality.  "
"5124",2009," Motlanthe","These difficulties have coincided with a period in which inflation and interest rates are still too high. "
"5125",2009," Motlanthe","Our thanks to the Governor of the Reserve Bank who yesterday announced a 1% reduction in the rate of interest.  "
"5126",2009," Motlanthe","Combined, these developments bode ill for the revenues we need to expand the provision of services and to implement our infrastructure projects. "
"5127",2009," Motlanthe","As such, we have been forced to tone down our forecasts in terms of growth and job-creation.  "
"5128",2009," Motlanthe","We know too that South Africa is less severely affected than many other countries. "
"5129",2009," Motlanthe","Indeed, in a period in which others are experiencing or projecting recessions, South Africa and the rest of the continent are still poised for growth, even if at a slower rate.  "
"5130",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, Honourable Members, I am happy to report that in the interactions between The Presidency and leaders of various social partners, we agreed jointly to devise interventions that would minimise the impact of this crisis on our society. "
"5131",2009," Motlanthe","The task team dealing with these matters is still hard at work; and the following broad categories of responses are under discussion:  Firstly, government will continue with its public investment projects, the value of which has increased to R690-billion for the next three years. "
"5132",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, where necessary, we will find creative ways to raise funds.  "
"5133",2009," Motlanthe","This will include support by our development finance institutions and loan finance from international agencies, as well as partnership with the private sector and utilisation of resources controlled by workers such as pension funds.  "
"5134",2009," Motlanthe","Secondly, we will intensify public sector employment programmes. "
"5135",2009," Motlanthe","On the one hand, plans to expand employment in sectors such as health, social work, education and law-enforcement agencies will continue. "
"5136",2009," Motlanthe","On the other, we will speed up the introduction of the next phase of the Expanded Public Works Programme.  "
"5137",2009," Motlanthe","Thirdly, mitigating actions can be undertaken within the private sector to counteract an excessive investment slowdown and unnecessary closures of production lines or plants.  "
"5138",2009," Motlanthe","On its part, government will adapt industrial financing and incentive instruments to help deal with challenges in various sectors, and also encourage development finance institutions to assist firms in distress because of the crisis.  "
"5139",2009," Motlanthe","Alternatives to layoffs will be explored, including longer holidays, extended training, short time and job-sharing. "
"5140",2009," Motlanthe","This will be combined with promotion of the Proudly South Africa campaign and stronger action on illegal imports.  "
"5141",2009," Motlanthe","Fourthly, government will sustain and expand social expenditure, including progressively extending access to the child support grant to children of 18 years of age and reducing the age of eligibility for old age pension to 60 years for men.  "
"5142",2009," Motlanthe","In addition, we will more widely utilise the Social Distress Relief Grant and food security measures specifically also to target those either unprotected by the Unemployment Insurance Fund or who have exhausted their benefits.  "
"5143",2009," Motlanthe","We shall also continue to pay special attention to the challenge of anti-competitive behaviour on the part of some of our corporations. "
"5144",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, we wish to commend the Competition Commission for the firm hand that they are showing to ensure that culprits are brought to book.   "
"5145",2009," Motlanthe","We do hope though that civil society will enhance its own level of activism to ensure, among other things, that as input prices decline, the benefit is felt by the population.  "
"5146",2009," Motlanthe","These immediate measures will be informed by the principle of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy. "
"5147",2009," Motlanthe","However, we will ensure that the levels of borrowing by government are prudent and sustainable. "
"5148",2009," Motlanthe","This also implies a rapid reduction in government debt levels whenever conditions turn for the better.  "
"5149",2009," Motlanthe","Our efforts will also be informed by the appreciation that measures to protect the environment and mitigate the impact of climate change can also contribute to job-creation.  "
"5150",2009," Motlanthe","Both in the G20 meetings and other interactions in multilateral institutions, our government has argued for appropriate and urgent interventions particularly in the developed countries whence the crisis originated and where it is most severe. "
"5151",2009," Motlanthe","We believe that the time has come to strengthen domestic regulation and supervision of the financial system; but beyond this, that stronger surveillance and action on a global scale have become unavoidable and necessary.  "
"5152",2009," Motlanthe","Critically, we should also safeguard the integrity of the world trade system, complete the current negotiations on the Doha Round of world trade negotiations, and ensure that development aid is not scaled down.  "
"5153",2009," Motlanthe","The abiding lesson from this experience is that we need stronger partnerships among economic role players on a domestic and global scale, not only to stem the impact of the crisis; but also to put in place measures that would obviate a recurrence.  "
"5154",2009," Motlanthe","In our own country, we will embark on these undertakings as part of the process of setting our society on a higher growth and development path. "
"5155",2009," Motlanthe","The length of time towards attaining a higher trajectory may have been stretched somewhat. "
"5156",2009," Motlanthe","But we are not in doubt that that moment will yet come sooner rather than later.  "
"5157",2009," Motlanthe","In this regard, how we position our country to take advantage of unique opportunities that have come our way, will be of paramount importance. "
"5158",2009," Motlanthe","I refer here in particular to the FIFA World Cup in 2010 as well as the Confederations Cup a few months from now. "
"5159",2009," Motlanthe","Virtually all the projects and plans are completed or nearing completion – from stadia, transport infrastructure, security measures, issues of accommodation, to health and immigration plans – confirming the confidence of the global soccer fraternity that ours will be a truly successful tournament.  "
"5160",2009," Motlanthe","And we believe that, after five consecutive wins, the national soccer team is now more confidently gearing itself to perform above expectations!  "
"5161",2009," Motlanthe","But beyond this, the true legacy of this spectacle will be in our ability to showcase South African and African hospitality and humanity – to change once and for all perceptions of our country and our continent among peoples of the world. "
"5162",2009," Motlanthe","That depends on all of us; and to that we can attach no price!  "
"5163",2009," Motlanthe","We also wish in this regard to congratulate all our sporting teams which have asserted South Africa’s pursuit of excellence over the past year. "
"5164",2009," Motlanthe","Special accolades are due to our cricket team which has climbed to the apex of global rankings.  "
"5165",2009," Motlanthe","We are of course Rugby World Champions; Giniel de Villiers and his team have won the Dakar Rally; our Paralympians continue to do us proud; and our under-20 soccer team did quite well in an extremely competitive environment.  "
"5166",2009," Motlanthe","Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson;    Just two weeks ago, South Africa completed with Mali part of the archives to preserve the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu.  "
"5167",2009," Motlanthe","This rich heritage points to Africa as a beacon of science and literature, philosophy and commerce, interrupted by the slave trade and the scramble for Africa’s wealth.  "
"5168",2009," Motlanthe","This initiative should spur us on to act in concert with other countries on our continent and further afield to better the human condition.  "
"5169",2009," Motlanthe","Indeed, over the past 15 years we have spared no effort to ensure that Africa experiences her renewal in what should in actual practice be the African Century. "
"5170",2009," Motlanthe","Steadily but surely, our continent is progressing towards her renaissance, with the interest of her people rising to the top of their leaders’ agenda, asserting her hope and her resilience on the world stage.  "
"5171",2009," Motlanthe","It is this, and this alone, that has informed our persistence in assisting the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the crisis in that country. "
"5172",2009," Motlanthe","We wish in this regard to congratulate all the parties in Zimbabwe for concluding negotiations, delivering the ultimate prize that has always been the wish of the people of that country and the sub-continent as a whole: that is, a stable and legitimate government geared to address the challenges that the people face. "
"5173",2009," Motlanthe","We are truly heartened that, yesterday, the Zimbabwean Parliament passed Amendment 19 of the Constitution, laying the basis for the installation of an inclusive government.    "
"5174",2009," Motlanthe","Special mention in this regard is due to SADC facilitator, former President Thabo Mbeki and the team that tirelessly and patiently helped to bring the process to a successful conclusion.  "
"5175",2009," Motlanthe","Now the work of reconstruction can start in earnest; and South Africa stands ready to assist wherever we can. "
"5176",2009," Motlanthe","In this respect, there is urgent need to assist in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in that country. "
"5177",2009," Motlanthe","We are confident that, because it cares, the international community will partner the people of Zimbabwe as they blaze out along a new trail.  "
"5178",2009," Motlanthe","We are also encouraged that, whatever fits and starts may seem to characterise the progress of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo on their march to stability and prosperity, that progress is inexorable.  "
"5179",2009," Motlanthe","The partnership built in the recent period between the leadership of the DRC and Rwanda holds out a promise for advances in matters of security and in dealing with the humanitarian crisis; but, hopefully, also with regard to political dialogue. "
"5180",2009," Motlanthe","In the same measure, we will continue to work with other countries and the African Union to pursue these objectives in Burundi, Sudan, Western Sahara, Côte d’Ivoire, Somalia and elsewhere.  "
"5181",2009," Motlanthe","As would have been evidenced by various developments in the past few months, South Africa will use the privilege of chairing SADC to strengthen this critical regional institution, with particular emphasis on implementing Summit resolutions and cementing regional strategic cohesion.   "
"5182",2009," Motlanthe","At the same time we will improve SADC’s interaction with the Common Market of East and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the East African Community (EAC). "
"5183",2009," Motlanthe","These initiatives will be undertaken in order to extend rather than weaken the deep set of relations that we enjoy within the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).  "
"5184",2009," Motlanthe","We wish on this occasion to extend our congratulations to the people and the leadership of Zambia, Ghana and the United States of America for elections the symbolism of which transcends the narrow boundaries of their nation-states.  "
"5185",2009," Motlanthe","We will as always seek to strengthen co-operation with these and other countries in pursuit of that which is good for humanity.  "
"5186",2009," Motlanthe","We are privileged that this year we conclude celebrations of the first decade of our diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. "
"5187",2009," Motlanthe","Over these years, it has become clearer than ever before that there is much mutual benefit to be gained from our partnership.  "
"5188",2009," Motlanthe","We also wish to affirm our commitment to the close relations that we have forged with Brazil and India through IBSA; and indeed to the strengthening bonds that our country has been forging with Russia, and countries in Asia, the Middle East, as well as Latin and North America.  "
"5189",2009," Motlanthe","We have on countless occasions expressed our concern at the persistence of conflict in the Middle East in general and in Israel and Palestine in particular.  "
"5190",2009," Motlanthe","The depth of our disappointment at the recent escalation of the conflict and massive loss of life, of especially civilians – including children, women and the elderly – indeed defies description.  "
"5191",2009," Motlanthe","There can be no justification for such acts of wanton destruction and savagery. "
"5192",2009," Motlanthe","And we do hope that this time round, the renewed efforts of the international community to find a lasting solution to this conflict will bear fruit, so Israelis and Palestinians can enjoy peace and security as neighbours within their sovereign territories.    "
"5193",2009," Motlanthe","Our special congratulations to the government and people of Cuba on this the 50th anniversary of the attainment of their sovereignty and, with it, the freedom to choose their path of development.  "
"5194",2009," Motlanthe","We were able in the past year to conclude further negotiations with the European Union on our strategic partnership; and we do hope that the spirit which informed that engagement will prevail as we finalise the multilateral negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements with countries in our region.  "
"5195",2009," Motlanthe","We look forward to further strengthening this partnership when we host the South Africa-EU Summit later this year.  "
"5196",2009," Motlanthe","Along with other countries of the South we will continue to pursue the cause of the restructuring of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions so they reflect the changed and changing global reality and operate in a democratic, equitable and transparent manner.  "
"5197",2009," Motlanthe","We also commit ourselves to meet the objectives of international agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol and its successors for the benefit of future generations among our own people and peoples of the world.  "
"5198",2009," Motlanthe","Madame Speaker and Honourable Chairperson;  Informing these our endeavours are two basic principles: the need for us to complete the mandate accorded this government in 2004; and the imperative to ensure that the government that comes in after the elections finds a ready platform to implement its programmes without undue delays.  "
"5199",2009," Motlanthe","In the coming few months pending the national and provincial elections, we will endeavour to complete that popular mandate. "
"5200",2009," Motlanthe","As part of the many detailed projects contained in the government’s Programme of Action, we will pay particular attention to:  creating the capacity necessary for improved service delivery and better integration within and across the spheres of government, including national strategic planning;  continuing with the War on Poverty campaign and finalising the draft of the Comprehensive Anti-poverty Strategy through the public consultations now under way;  implementing the comprehensive programme we have put in place to eliminate the incidence of cholera in various parts of the country;  continuing research and consultations on the Comprehensive Social Security System, including the matter of National Health Insurance;  intensifying the campaign to save energy, so as to manage the current difficulties and change our own behaviour, while at the same time speeding up the projects to build new capacity and utilise alternative energy sources – recognising that in addition to the consequences of climate change, resources such as fossil fuels and water are declining in the same measure as demand is increasing;  integrating into the work of the relevant Clusters the findings of research on Second Economy interventions such as the community works programme, support for small and micro-enterprises and rural development initiatives;  intensifying efforts to revamp the criminal justice system, including better forensic capacity, rapid increase in the number of detectives, optimal utilisation of information and communications technology, and better management of the courts; and  facilitating the processes aimed at strengthening the machineries dealing with matters of gender equality such as 50/50 representation in decision-making structures, youth development, the rights of people with disability and children’s rights – including completing consultations on the National Youth Policy, preparing for the implementation of the African Youth Charter once it has been processed by Parliament, and for the setting up of the National Youth Development Agency; submitting the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development to Parliament; strengthening advocacy on the rights of people with disability; and extending the number of municipalities that have set up Children’s Rights Focal Points beyond the current 60%.  "
"5201",2009," Motlanthe","These and other programmes, including the Apex Priorities identified in the State of the Nation Address last February, form the bedrock of our efforts to conclude the popular mandate and lay the foundation for the future.  "
"5202",2009," Motlanthe","We will intensify our efforts inspired by the enthusiasm, the hope and the resilience of the South African people in pursuit of that which is good for all of us. "
"5203",2009," Motlanthe","This, and this in the main, is the source of our confidence when we say that the nation is in a good state. "
"5204",2009," Motlanthe","Our democracy is healthy. "
"5205",2009," Motlanthe","It is steadily growing stronger.    "
"5206",2009," Motlanthe","And so, in the words of former President Mandela, “[we] dare not linger, for [our] long walk is not yet ended”.  "
"5207",2009," Motlanthe","I thank you."
"5208",2008,"Mbeki"," Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP); Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; Deputy President of the Republic; Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament; Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Mr Jacob Zuma, Former Deputy President of the Republic and President of the African National Congress; Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary; Heads of our Security Services; Governor of the Reserve Bank; Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces; Chairperson of SALGA, mayors and leaders in our system of local government; Chairperson of the National house of traditional leaders and our honoured traditional leaders; Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy; Directors-General and other leaders of the public service; Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners; Distinguished guests, friends and comrades;  People of South Africa:  Allow me on this occasion of the penultimate Joint Sitting of the third Parliament for the annual debate on the state of our nation, to wish all the Honourable Members of Parliament a happy and productive New Year.  "
"5209",2008,"Mbeki","I am confident that 2008 will be one of the most remarkable years of our democracy, as we all work together to realise the core aspiration of our people to attain a better life for all. "
"5210",2008,"Mbeki","I say this because, in our own estimation, it is not often that a nation is called upon to strain every sinew of its collective body to attain a dream. "
"5211",2008,"Mbeki","And such is the injunction that history has imposed on us today.  "
"5212",2008,"Mbeki","I speak here today in the presence of my mother, Epainette Mbeki, MaMofokeng, who came to communicate an unequivocal message from the rural masses of the Transkei, among whom she has lived for many decades. "
"5213",2008,"Mbeki","She says these masses demand of all of us who claim to be their leaders, that we tell them and others like them elsewhere in our country, whether we remain committed to the undertaking we have made that tomorrow will be better than today. "
"5214",2008,"Mbeki","In eight days' time, on February 16, she will be 92 years old. "
"5215",2008,"Mbeki","What she expects as her birthday present is the truth. "
"5216",2008,"Mbeki","I thank her for taking the trouble to be with us today, and trust that we will not disappoint her.  "
"5217",2008,"Mbeki","I would also like to take this opportunity to salute President Nelson Mandela, one of the pre-eminent founding fathers of our democracy, who will mark his 90th birthday on 18 July this year.  "
"5218",2008,"Mbeki","We welcome to this occasion Mr Arthur Margeman, representing the veterans of the Alexandra bus boycott of fifty years ago, who include Nelson Mandela. "
"5219",2008,"Mbeki","We are also privileged to have among us Ms Jann Turner, the daughter of Rick Turner who was murdered by apartheid agents 30 years ago.  "
"5220",2008,"Mbeki","We are also pleased that we have among us Mr Dinilesizwe Sobukwe, son of the outstanding patriot and leader, Robert Sobukwe, who also passed away 30 years back after enduring many years of imprisonment, banishment and other forms of repression. "
"5221",2008,"Mbeki","We acknowledge, both among the Honourable Members and our guests, the many founders of the United Democratic Front, 25 years ago.  "
"5222",2008,"Mbeki","All these honoured guests, representing both memory and hope, remind us by their presence that ours is a task in a relay race of continuous rebirth so that the dream of a better life becomes a reality for all South Africans. "
"5223",2008,"Mbeki","Indeed, they represent a celebration of the indomitable spirit of our people, and pose a challenge to all of us to act in ways that do not betray or disappoint the expectations of the people.  "
"5224",2008,"Mbeki","We are about to begin the last full financial year of the current and third democratic parliament and government soon after which we will hold our fourth general elections. "
"5225",2008,"Mbeki","The Government has therefore reviewed the distance we have travelled in terms of implementing the mandate given by the people in 2004.  "
"5226",2008,"Mbeki","I am pleased to say that we have indeed done much to implement the commitments we made to the people in 2004. "
"5227",2008,"Mbeki","However, and not unexpectedly, it is obvious that we still have outstanding work to do in this regard.  "
"5228",2008,"Mbeki","Given that we are approaching the end of our mandate term, the Government decided that it should identify a suite of Apex Priorities on which it must focus in a special way, using these as catalysts further to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the objectives the people mandated us to pursue.  "
"5229",2008,"Mbeki","Happily, this State of the Nation Address has given me the possibility to report to Parliament and the Nation on our 24 Apex Priorities which, the Hon Members can find on the Government website during the course of next week.  "
"5230",2008,"Mbeki","The identification of the Apex Priorities means that all three spheres of government, the national, provincial and local, at both executive and administrative levels, are hereby making the firm undertaking that we will use the short period ahead of us further to energise our advance towards the realisation of the all-important goal of a better life for all our people.  "
"5231",2008,"Mbeki","The entirety of our system of governance is therefore making the commitment that in the period ahead of us, it will do its best to live up to the imperative – Business Unusual! "
"5232",2008,"Mbeki","We speak of Business Unusual not referring to any changes in our established policies but with regard to the speedy, efficient and effective implementation of these policies and programmes, so that the lives of our people should change for the better, sooner rather than later.  "
"5233",2008,"Mbeki","To make certain that this happens, we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Annual Budget the Minister of Finance will present later this month makes the necessary allocations to give us the means to implement the Apex Priorities. "
"5234",2008,"Mbeki","The main categories of these priorities are:  * the further acceleration of our economic growth and development  * speeding up the process of building the infrastructure we need to achieve our economic and social goals  * improving the effectiveness of our interventions directed at the Second Economy, and poverty eradication  * enhancing the impact of our programmes targeting the critically important area of education and training  * accelerating our advance towards the achievement of the goal of health for all  * revamping the criminal justice system to intensify our offensive against crime  * further strengthening the machinery of government to ensure that it has the capacity to respond to our development imperatives and,  * enhancing our focus on key areas in terms of our system of international relations, with particular focus on some African issues and South-South relations.  "
"5235",2008,"Mbeki","More than at any other time, the situation that confronts our nation and country, and the tasks we have set ourselves, demand that we inspire and organise all our people to act together as one, to do all the things that have to be done, understanding that in a very real sense, all of us, together, hold our own future in our hands!  "
"5236",2008,"Mbeki","As we act together everywhere in our country, this we must also understand that what we have to be about is – Business Unusual!  "
"5237",2008,"Mbeki","As I was preparing this Address, one among us suggested to me that our country was being buffeted by strong crosswinds that made it especially difficult to foresee where our country will be tomorrow.  "
"5238",2008,"Mbeki","He suggested that this morning, to capture what he considers the essence of the reality confronting us, I should recall the well-known words with which Charles Dickens opened his novel, A Tale of Two Cities. "
"5239",2008,"Mbeki","And so I quote these words:  ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.""  "
"5240",2008,"Mbeki","You will ask whether I agree with this assessment, whether I too believe that we have entered an era of confusion, in which all of us cannot but lose our way, unsure of our steps, unsteady on our feet, fearful of the future!  "
"5241",2008,"Mbeki","My answer to this question is a definite No! "
"5242",2008,"Mbeki","Like the rest of our Government I am convinced that the fundamentals that have informed our country's forward march in the last 14 years remain in place. "
"5243",2008,"Mbeki","They continue to provide us with the strong base from which we must proceed as we keep our eyes firmly focused on the continued pursuit of the goal of a better life for all our people. "
"5244",2008,"Mbeki","Thus should we all reaffirm that we remain on course as we continue to strive to make ours a winning nation.  "
"5245",2008,"Mbeki","However, like all the Honourable Members, I am aware of the fact that many in our society are troubled by a deep sense of unease about where our country will be tomorrow.  "
"5246",2008,"Mbeki","They are concerned about the national emergency into which the country has been thrown by the unexpected disruptions in the supply of electricity.  "
"5247",2008,"Mbeki","They are concerned about some developments in our economy, especially the steady increase in interest rates, food and fuel prices which further impoverish especially the poor. "
"5248",2008,"Mbeki","Some among these worry about the possible impact on our own economy of the threat of economic recession in the United States.  "
"5249",2008,"Mbeki","They are worried about whether we have the capacity to defend the democratic rights and the democratic Constitution which were born of enormous sacrifices. "
"5250",2008,"Mbeki","This is driven by such developments as the prosecution of the National Commissioner of Police, the suspension of the National Director of Public Prosecutions, fears about a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, and the attendant allegations about the abuse of state power for political purposes.  "
"5251",2008,"Mbeki","They are worried about whether our country is threatened by the anarchy represented by the criminal torching of six passenger trains in Tshwane last month.  "
"5252",2008,"Mbeki","While they recognise and respect the right of the ruling party to regulate its own affairs, they are concerned that it must continue to play its role as one of the principal architects of a democratic, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous South Africa.  "
"5253",2008,"Mbeki","Most obviously it would be irresponsible to ignore these and other concerns or dismiss them as mere jeremiads typical of the prophets of doom. "
"5254",2008,"Mbeki","The real challenge is to respond to them in a manner that conveys the definite message to everybody in our country and the millions in Africa and elsewhere in the world who watch our country with keen interest, that we remain firm in our resolve to continue building the kind of South Africa that has given hope not only to our people, but also to many others outside our borders.  "
"5255",2008,"Mbeki","Let me therefore make bold to say that this historical moment demands that our nation should unite as never before and strain every sinew of its collective body to address our common challenges and keep alive the dream that has sustained all of us as we travelled along the uncharted road towards the creation of the South Africa visualised in our Constitution.  "
"5256",2008,"Mbeki","The national emergency represented by the current power outages poses the challenge and presents the opportunity to the entirety of our nation to give concrete expression to the call we have just made for all of us to unite in action and act in unity to keep our country on course. "
"5257",2008,"Mbeki","This must say to all of us that we are indeed in a period of challenges, but surmountable challenges. "
"5258",2008,"Mbeki","And precisely because it is a period of challenges, it is also an era of opportunity!  "
"5259",2008,"Mbeki","In this regard, I would like to express our appreciation and full agreement with the comments made by the Chief Executive of Anglo American, Cynthia Carroll, when she addressed the Mining Indaba here in Cape Town earlier this week, on Tuesday, February 5.  "
"5260",2008,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members know, she said: ""I don't regard the problems of energy supply here as a disaster. "
"5261",2008,"Mbeki","And South Africa is not alone: there are pressures on supply regarding our expansion projects in Chile and Brazil.  "
"5262",2008,"Mbeki","""Sure, the problems here are serious; overcoming them will require ingenuity, especially in energy efficiency and energy saving, as well as the development of alternative power supplies. "
"5263",2008,"Mbeki","But if all of us can forge strong partnerships to tackle the situation, we will all come through – I hope relatively unscathed”¦This is not a time for finger pointing, but for working together in finding solutions.""  "
"5264",2008,"Mbeki","This having been said, it is however also necessary that we take this opportunity to convey to the country the apologies of both the Government and Eskom for the national emergency which has resulted in all of us having to contend with the consequences of load shedding. "
"5265",2008,"Mbeki","I would also like to thank all citizens for their resilience and forbearing in the face of the current difficulties.  "
"5266",2008,"Mbeki","In the past two weeks, the Ministers of Minerals and Energy and Public Enterprises have outlined the nature of the emergency we confront and what each one of us can do to normalise the situation. "
"5267",2008,"Mbeki","Last week the Honourable Members had an opportunity to reflect on these matters.  "
"5268",2008,"Mbeki","In essence the significant rise in electricity demand over the last two years has outstripped the new capacity we have brought on stream. "
"5269",2008,"Mbeki","The resultant tight supply situation makes the overall system vulnerable to any incident affecting the availability of energy. "
"5270",2008,"Mbeki","In this situation, we have to curtail the unplanned outages and the only way we can do this immediately is reduce demand and thus ensure a better reserve margin.  "
"5271",2008,"Mbeki","As government our task is to now lead and unite the country behind a campaign for energy efficiency that will address this challenge. "
"5272",2008,"Mbeki","Among other things, we must use the current adversity to ensure that our homes and economy become more energy efficient.  "
"5273",2008,"Mbeki","There are concrete actions each individual, household and business can take. "
"5274",2008,"Mbeki","These are being disseminated by the Department of Minerals and Energy and we remain open to any other suggestions that you, our compatriots, may give to us and share with one another.  "
"5275",2008,"Mbeki","Government will start implementing a campaign to ensure efficient lighting, solar water heating and geyser load management in households, including housing standards for all new houses and developments. "
"5276",2008,"Mbeki","We urge households that can afford to act immediately to consider implementing these energy-saving measures.  "
"5277",2008,"Mbeki","An instruction has been issued for all government buildings to reduce their consumption of electricity and please feel free to name and shame those who do not.  "
"5278",2008,"Mbeki","The details of other voluntary and mandatory actions in the Power Conservation Programme have been set out by the Ministers and these will be refined through consultation with the various stakeholders and then published.  "
"5279",2008,"Mbeki","On the supply side Eskom is working furiously to ensure the introduction of co-generation projects as a matter of urgency. "
"5280",2008,"Mbeki","We are taking steps to enhance Eskom's maintenance capacity. "
"5281",2008,"Mbeki","We have emergency task teams dealing with the challenge of coal quality and supply with the coal mining industry and we are working to fast track the approval and construction of gas turbine projects. "
"5282",2008,"Mbeki","All these actions, taken together with the electricity saving measures, will improve certainty and raise the reserve margin.  "
"5283",2008,"Mbeki","The massive Eskom build programme in new generation, transmission and distribution capacity will continue; and where possible, some projects will be accelerated. "
"5284",2008,"Mbeki","In this regard, I would like to thank the private sector for being prepared to assist in whatever way they can. "
"5285",2008,"Mbeki","In a meeting with the Chairman of General Electric (GE) during the course of last week, GE offered to assist by procuring scarce turbine equipment on our behalf. "
"5286",2008,"Mbeki","In South Africa our own large companies such as Sasol, Anglo and BHP Billiton are all in concrete discussions with the Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises to find cost effective and sustainable solutions to the supply constraint. "
"5287",2008,"Mbeki","The approach is one of common action rather than recrimination.  "
"5288",2008,"Mbeki","I particularly want to pay tribute to the mining industry for the way in which they have assisted us and the economy to resolve a real crisis that hit us on the 24th of January. "
"5289",2008,"Mbeki","We will all work to minimise the adverse impact these events had on the industry.  "
"5290",2008,"Mbeki","Collective effort and consultation are at the centre of our response to the emergency. "
"5291",2008,"Mbeki","Task teams are currently working in many areas. "
"5292",2008,"Mbeki","Next week the Provincial Premiers will convene their fora with mayors to plan and implement the energy saving measures in all the municipalities across the country. "
"5293",2008,"Mbeki","They will be supported by technical teams from EDI Holdings, Eskom and the National Energy Efficiency Agency. "
"5294",2008,"Mbeki","The Department of Provincial and Local Government will co-ordinate this activity supported by the line Departments of Mineral and Energy and Public Enterprises.  "
"5295",2008,"Mbeki","I will convene a meeting of the Joint Presidential Working Groups to co-ordinate our overall actions. "
"5296",2008,"Mbeki","I will also shortly announce a team of 'Energy Champions' consisting of prominent and knowledgeable South Africans who will assist government with the energy efficiency campaign and inform investors and communities on the actual situation and how they can help to address our current challenges.  "
"5297",2008,"Mbeki","The Minister of Finance will provide more information in the Budget speech on the support that the government will provide for the energy efficiency campaign and to Eskom in its build programme.  "
"5298",2008,"Mbeki","We face an emergency but we can overcome the problems in a relatively short period. "
"5299",2008,"Mbeki","This situation has precipitated the inevitable realisation that the era of very cheap and abundant electricity has come to an end. "
"5300",2008,"Mbeki","However, given our large base of installed generation capacity, for a long time to come ours will remain amongst the few economies with affordable electricity.  "
"5301",2008,"Mbeki","We are a minerals resource economy. "
"5302",2008,"Mbeki","We must therefore continue to support the mining industry. "
"5303",2008,"Mbeki","It is inevitable that if we are to continue on our growth path as a manufacturing country, we will also have to continue supporting the processing industry. "
"5304",2008,"Mbeki","However it is imperative that all enterprises become more energy efficient. "
"5305",2008,"Mbeki","Indeed, energy efficiency itself provides economic opportunity.  "
"5306",2008,"Mbeki","Let us therefore use this emergency to put in place the first building blocks of the essential energy efficient future we dare not avoid. "
"5307",2008,"Mbeki","Let us ensure that all hands are on deck to address the turbulence that has hit us, inspired by the approach that our circumstances call for Business Unusual!  "
"5308",2008,"Mbeki","This is exactly the same approach we must adopt as we continue to prepare to host the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2009 and the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup which will kick off in our country 854 days from today. "
"5309",2008,"Mbeki","I mention this important matter here because the current challenges we are facing have led some elsewhere in the world once more to question whether we will be able to host these tournaments successfully.  "
"5310",2008,"Mbeki","Of course, I have absolutely no doubt that we will honour our undertaking to FIFA and the world community of soccer players and lovers to create all the necessary conditions for the holding of the best ever FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament.  "
"5311",2008,"Mbeki","The sense that we get, across all sectors of South African society and further afield, represented by the actual daily progress we are making in terms of our all-round preparations, is one of - Business Unusual: all hands on deck for 2010! "
"5312",2008,"Mbeki","We must ensure that we sustain this approach.  "
"5313",2008,"Mbeki","We are fully aware that a critical element of our preparations should be the building of a strong South African team which will do us and the whole of the football fraternity proud. "
"5314",2008,"Mbeki","I am certain that the South African Football Association, our coaches led by Carlos Alberto Parreira, and the players are aware of the heavy responsibility they carry to prepare a national team of which both we and Africa should be proud.  "
"5315",2008,"Mbeki","Once more we thank the Springboks for showing the way when they won the Rugby World Cup last year. "
"5316",2008,"Mbeki","This must inspire Bafana Bafana, as it must inspire our athletes who will compete in the Beijing Olympic Games later this year.  "
"5317",2008,"Mbeki","Let me now turn to the Apex Priorities I mentioned.  "
"5318",2008,"Mbeki","Further to accelerate our economic growth and development we will implement the Industrial Policy Action Plan. "
"5319",2008,"Mbeki","Government will continue our industrialisation programme and continue to create opportunities for growth and employment-creation. "
"5320",2008,"Mbeki","In this regard, R2,3 billion has been budgeted for industrial policy initiatives and a further R5 billion in tax incentives over three years will support industrial policy.  "
"5321",2008,"Mbeki","Working together with business and labour, we shall also develop as urgently as possible, key action plans in sectors where such plans do not exist, such as mining and minerals beneficiation, consumer durables, retail with a focus on improving support to small enterprises, construction, the creative industries, agriculture and agro-processing.  "
"5322",2008,"Mbeki","Once more I would like to emphasise that we remain determined to support the automotive sector and will therefore ensure that the support given to this sector through the Motor Industry Development Programme is maintained.  "
"5323",2008,"Mbeki","At the macro-economic level, we will continue to maintain a fiscal posture that supports continued economic growth and development and reducing our external vulnerability.  "
"5324",2008,"Mbeki","To speed up the process of building infrastructure we will finalise the development of an integrated infrastructure plan, with specific emphasis on energy efficiency. "
"5325",2008,"Mbeki","This entails co-ordinating the programmes of the State-owned Enterprises and overlaying all the infrastructure plans, including freight and other logistics, energy pipelines, information and communications technology, road infrastructure, water and electricity, both in terms of their timing and geographic location.  "
"5326",2008,"Mbeki","Cutting across these plans, and therefore a critical priority, is information and communications technology both as a facilitator and a sector in its own right. "
"5327",2008,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we will this year complete the licensing and operationalisation of Infraco. "
"5328",2008,"Mbeki","Already, money has been allocated for Sentech to become a wireless internet wholesaler as well as finance its digitisation. "
"5329",2008,"Mbeki","Working with other governments on the continent and the private sector, we will complete the process to launch the undersea cables.  "
"5330",2008,"Mbeki","At the same time, we aim to provide digital broadcasting to 50% of the population by the end of the year. "
"5331",2008,"Mbeki","Attached to this will be a manufacturing strategy for the development in South Africa of Set Top Boxes, which should be finalised by the middle of the year.  "
"5332",2008,"Mbeki","Having noted that the tardiness with which government processes applications for investment in relation to issues such as land acquisition, infrastructure and environmental impact assessments can at times make or break investor decisions, we have decided, in the spirit of Business Unusual, work is progressing urgently to set up a call centre through which prospective investors and government can track these processes.  "
"5333",2008,"Mbeki","An element of government's Apex of Priorities will be deliberate focus on matters of skills development. "
"5334",2008,"Mbeki","Work to review the National Human Resource Development Strategy will be completed this year, and the projects that the joint team of government, labour, business and academic institutions organised under the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition (JIPSA) will be intensified.  "
"5335",2008,"Mbeki","Indeed, we are greatly encouraged by the good response from the private sector as demonstrated through the commitment by the CEOs of 70 of the JSE-listed companies to work with government in addressing the challenge of scarce skills.  "
"5336",2008,"Mbeki","In addition to this work we will in the coming period prioritise further interventions in the further education and training (FET) colleges, the sector education and training authorities (SETAs), resourcing schools in the lowest three quintiles, freeing them from the responsibility to charge fees, and speeding up on-the-job training for professional graduates.  "
"5337",2008,"Mbeki","Further, after correcting weaknesses in our Adult Basic Education programme, which we identified last year, we shall this month launch the Kha Ri Gude (let us learn) mass literacy campaign. "
"5338",2008,"Mbeki","This will include the training of master trainers who will provide basic literacy classes to 300 000 adults and youth in 2008.  "
"5339",2008,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Chairperson  At the centre of our economic programmes is, and should always be, the consideration whether their success is helping to improve the quality of life of all South Africans, acting as an important weapon in our War on Poverty and accelerating our advance towards the attainment of such objectives as the reduction of unemployment and advancing the goal of health for all.  "
"5340",2008,"Mbeki","In the programme to provide sustainable human settlements, we are now able to provide 260 000 housing units per annum, and an agreement has been reached with the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) to place a moratorium on the sale of land that can be availed for the housing programme.  "
"5341",2008,"Mbeki","Along with the progress we are making in the variety of interventions focused on poverty reduction, we continue to address a number many weaknesses, including the processing of the Land Use Management Bill, the finalisation of the land restitution cases, the support programme for those who acquire land, and the development and implementation of a determined rural development programme.  "
"5342",2008,"Mbeki","These are some of the issues to which we will pay special attention during this year, and ensure that we meet the targets we have set ourselves.  "
"5343",2008,"Mbeki","Yet another critical Apex Priority is the elaboration of an integrated and comprehensive anti-poverty strategy that addresses especially sections of the population most affected by this scourge. "
"5344",2008,"Mbeki","These include children, women, the youth, people living in rural areas and urban informal settlements, people with disabilities or chronic illnesses and the elderly.  "
"5345",2008,"Mbeki","Among the key proposed interventions are: expanding the public works programme, employment subsidies for direct job-creation for targeted groups, enhancing employment search capability, improving education and training, improving services and assets among poor communities, specific interventions in poor households, and ensuring effectiveness of institutions supporting women and other sectors. "
"5346",2008,"Mbeki","Among others, we will make an evaluation of the gender machinery so as to improve all aspects related to women empowerment.  "
"5347",2008,"Mbeki","Parallel to this initiative is a special project to examine interventions required to deal with vulnerable children over the age of 14.  "
"5348",2008,"Mbeki","But we will all agree that our society, and the poor specifically, cannot wait for strategies and dialogues and workshops – important as these may be. "
"5349",2008,"Mbeki","In any case, most of the interventions possible are things that government is already doing though not sufficiently integrated. "
"5350",2008,"Mbeki","As such, in the spirit of Business Unusual, government intends this year to intensify the campaign to identify specific households and individuals in dire need and to put in place interventions that will help, in the intervening period, to alleviate their plight in those individual households.  "
"5351",2008,"Mbeki","For this, we will require a National War Room for a War Against Poverty bringing together departments such as Social Development, Provincial and Local Government, Trade and Industry, Agriculture and Land Affairs, Public Works and Health as well as provincial and local administrations, which will work with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and business to identify the interventions required in specific households and implement them as a matter of urgency.  "
"5352",2008,"Mbeki","We shall this year attend to other specific priorities which are critical to the country's war against poverty, in pursuit of socio-economic inclusion. "
"5353",2008,"Mbeki","These are:  * speeding up land and agrarian reform with detailed plans for land acquisition, better implementation of agricultural support services and household food support, and improving the capital base and reach of the Micro-Agricultural Finance Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA) to provide micro-credit in this sector: focus will be placed on areas of large concentrations of farm dwellers and those with high eviction rates, and we aim to increase black entrepreneurship in agricultural production by 5% per year, and the audit on land ownership will be speeded up;  * the Budget will provide for an increase in the social grant system by equalising the age of eligibility at 60, thus benefiting about half a million men;  * intensifying efforts already started to scale up assistance to co-operatives and small enterprises especially those involving women, with emphasis on providing training and markets, including linking them up with established outlets;  * scaling up the National Youth Service programme including a graduated increase of the intake in the Military Skills Development programme of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) from the current 4 000 to 10 000. "
"5354",2008,"Mbeki","R700 million has already been given to the SANDF to start scaling up this programme;  * intensifying the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) which, by surpassing the set targets, has shown potential to absorb more entrants: this will include increased intake of young people in the programme to maintain public infrastructure, doubling the number of children enrolled in Early Childhood Development to over 600 000 through 1 000 new sites with more than 3 500 practitioners trained and employed, and increasing the number of care-givers. "
"5355",2008,"Mbeki","About R1 billion over the baseline will be allocated to programmes that fall within the EPWP; and, lastly,  * introducing the system of products for preferential procurement by government from small, medium and micro-enterprises; and through the Small Enterprises Development Agency setting up a rigorous system to ensure that the 30-day payment period is observed.  "
"5356",2008,"Mbeki","We will also integrate the programme to speed up the development of sustainable human settlements, with intensified efforts, as a matter of urgent priority, to accelerate universal access to water, sanitation and electricity, so that by 2014, we should have decent human settlements and access by all households to these services.  "
"5357",2008,"Mbeki","Accelerating our advance towards the achievement of a goal of health for all includes intensified implementation of the National Strategic Plan against HIV and AIDS. "
"5358",2008,"Mbeki","We also aim during the course of this year to reduce tuberculosis (TB) defaulter rates from 10% to 7%, train over 3 000 health personnel in the management of this disease and ensure that all multi-drug resistant and extreme drug resistant TB patients receive treatment.  "
"5359",2008,"Mbeki","We aim to complete the work on the comprehensive social security system, benefiting from the consultations that have started with social partners.  "
"5360",2008,"Mbeki","As we put all our hands on deck and gear ourselves for Business Unusual we should also intensify national dialogue on the issues that define us as a nation.  "
"5361",2008,"Mbeki","Two such issues deserve brief mention.  "
"5362",2008,"Mbeki","The first of these is a proposal that we should develop an oath that will be recited by learners in their morning school assemblies, as well as a Youth Pledge extolling the virtues of humane conduct and human solidarity among all South Africans. "
"5363",2008,"Mbeki","The Minister of Education will next week elaborate on the national debate on these matters.  "
"5364",2008,"Mbeki","The second issue is about geographic and place names, which requires a synchronised process across all provinces so we can create a base slate of changes we propose. "
"5365",2008,"Mbeki","We will launch this synchronised process soon, guided by the South African Geographical Names Council and its provincial committees.  "
"5366",2008,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Chairperson,  When we reflected on the issue of crime at last year's Joint Sitting of Parliament, we all expressed grave concern not only at the high rates of crime, but also at the indication that things seemed to be turning for the worse especially in respect of murder – bucking the trend of the improvement since the attainment of democracy.  "
"5367",2008,"Mbeki","Accordingly, last year we engaged in systematic interaction with business and other sectors of the population, to develop a holistic approach towards revamping the criminal justice system in its totality.  "
"5368",2008,"Mbeki","In this regard, in the spirit of Business Unusual, Cabinet has agreed on a set of changes that are required to establish a new, modernised, efficient and transformed criminal justice system. "
"5369",2008,"Mbeki","Among other things, this will entail setting up a new co-ordinating and management structure for the system at every level, from national to local, bringing together the judiciary and magistracy, the police, prosecutors, correctional services and the Legal Aid Board, as well as other interventions, including the empowerment of the Community Police Forums.  "
"5370",2008,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members are aware, some of these initiatives are already under way; but we are certain that, if they are all carried out in an integrated and complementary manner, the impact will be that much more effective in our fight against crime. "
"5371",2008,"Mbeki","The Ministers of the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will elaborate on the details of this and other initiatives during the course of next week.  "
"5372",2008,"Mbeki","We shall also, during the course of this year, process the Bills on the transformation of the judiciary in consultation with judges and magistrates, complete the strategy aimed at strengthening border control and security, further give life to the Victims' Charter, pay particular attention to the issue of repeat offenders, and continue the implementation of additional measures deriving from recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  "
"5373",2008,"Mbeki","Informed by the imperative to intensify the offensive against organised crime, as well as the recommendations of the Khampepe Judicial Commission on the functioning and location of the Directorate of Special Operations and continuing reflections on this matter, including the reform of the Criminal Justice System, we shall by the end of March this year, interact with Parliament on legislation and other decisive measures required further to enhance our capacity to fight organised crime.  "
"5374",2008,"Mbeki","What will continue to inform us as we take this step will be the absolute commitment of government to fight organised crime and improve the management, efficiency and co-ordination of our law-enforcement agencies.  "
"5375",2008,"Mbeki","Of great importance, our success in the fight against crime depends on co-operation among all of us as law-abiding citizens, inspired by the principles of rule of law, respect for our judiciary and pursuit of equal human rights, which our Constitution enjoins us to observe in our daily lives and pronouncements.  "
"5376",2008,"Mbeki","Honourable Members  We will continue this year with efforts to improve the machinery of government so that it meets its obligations to citizens. "
"5377",2008,"Mbeki","If anything, the spirit of Business Unusual should apply to all individuals who carry the privilege of being public servants.  "
"5378",2008,"Mbeki","There are simple but urgent and critical priorities we will attend to, as part of the overall effort to improve the organisation and capacity of the state.  "
"5379",2008,"Mbeki","Firstly, it has been agreed across all spheres of government that especially the critical vacancies should be filled within six months of such openings emerging. "
"5380",2008,"Mbeki","The Department of Public Service and Administration will set up a monitoring system to track the implementation of this decision.  "
"5381",2008,"Mbeki","Secondly, by May of every year (and within two months of the beginning of the financial year at local government level) all senior managers should have filed their Key Performance Agreements with relevant authorities. "
"5382",2008,"Mbeki","The Office of the Public Service Commission will set up monitoring systems in this regard.  "
"5383",2008,"Mbeki","Thirdly, recognising that the Department of Home Affairs touches the core of every citizen's life, we will this year intensify the implementation of the turn-around strategy approved by Cabinet. "
"5384",2008,"Mbeki","This includes improving the information technology (IT) systems, training of staff on the new systems, rooting out corrupt elements and piloting the new ID card.  "
"5385",2008,"Mbeki","Improvement of performance in the public service also depends on the quality of leadership provided by the executive and senior management. "
"5386",2008,"Mbeki","Further, it is critical to enhance the commitment of public employees to their duties – a task that belongs to the leadership, the public servants themselves and the trade union movement.  "
"5387",2008,"Mbeki","In this regard, this year, in consultation with public sector unions, we will convene a Public Sector Summit to thrash out these issues so that the spirit of Batho Pele can find concrete expression wherever a government service is provided.  "
"5388",2008,"Mbeki","Working with other social partners, we shall ensure that, by the end of this year, the second National Anti-corruption Programme is adopted, and that the action plan agreed with organised business is implemented. "
"5389",2008,"Mbeki","At local government level, we shall assist the first 150 of our municipalities to develop anti-corruption strategies.  "
"5390",2008,"Mbeki","We shall continue this year to intensify efforts to strengthen local government capacity in line with the 5-year Local Government Strategic Agenda. "
"5391",2008,"Mbeki","To ensure systematic monitoring in this regard, SALGA has agreed to provide quarterly reports on the work being done.  "
"5392",2008,"Mbeki","In order further to improve the service being provided to vulnerable sectors such as veterans, women and youth, we shall review the structures delegated to carry out these functions and examine the most appropriate arrangements, including the evaluation of the government structures specifically established to focus on youth development and empowerment.  "
"5393",2008,"Mbeki","Many of the challenges in our work which we have identified derive from serious weaknesses in terms of our planning. "
"5394",2008,"Mbeki","Thus, as part of our Apex Priorities in the coming period we will complete the processes that will enable us to enhance government's capacity to put in place realistic and integrated plans, covering all spheres of government.  "
"5395",2008,"Mbeki","Honourable Members  The programme that we have outlined incorporates the commitments that our country has agreed with the leadership of the continent through the African Peer Review Mechanism.  "
"5396",2008,"Mbeki","Our focus, in promoting the African Agenda this year, will be on the strengthening of the African institutions, including the African Union and its development programme, Nepad.  "
"5397",2008,"Mbeki","This we shall do, inspired by the common aspiration of the peoples of the continent for greater integration in pursuit of continental unity at all levels. "
"5398",2008,"Mbeki","A critical step in this regard is the consolidation of regional institutions and activities aimed at achieving regional integration.  "
"5399",2008,"Mbeki","We continue to be committed to a free trade area in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and hope to use our Chairpersonship of SADC in 2008/2009 further to give impetus to the regional endeavours in this regard.  "
"5400",2008,"Mbeki","It is in this context, as well, that we shall continue our bilateral and multilateral interactions with our neighbours and the European Union, within the context of the process led by the African Union (AU), to ensure that the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement are completed as soon as possible, premised on accelerating the development of our region.  "
"5401",2008,"Mbeki","Over the past year, we carried out the mandate of SADC to assist the political leadership of Zimbabwe to find a lasting solution to the political challenges they face. "
"5402",2008,"Mbeki","We had an opportunity, on the fringes of the AU Summit in Addis Ababa formally to present a comprehensive report to the leadership of SADC on this matter.  "
"5403",2008,"Mbeki","In short, the parties involved in the dialogue have reached full agreement on all matters relating to the substantive matters the parties had to address. "
"5404",2008,"Mbeki","These include issues relating to the Constitution, security, media and electoral laws, and other matters that have been in contention for many years. "
"5405",2008,"Mbeki","The relevant laws in this regard have already been approved by parliament, including the necessary constitutional amendments. "
"5406",2008,"Mbeki","What is outstanding, however, is a procedural matter relating to the timing and the manner of enactment of the new agreed Draft Constitution.  "
"5407",2008,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we join the SADC Heads of State and Government in congratulating the parties to the Zimbabwe Dialogue for their truly commendable achievements and encourage them to work together to resolve the remaining procedural matter. "
"5408",2008,"Mbeki","As requested by the SADC Heads of State and Government we remain ready to continue to facilitate the Zimbabwe negotiations. "
"5409",2008,"Mbeki","At the same time, we wish the people of Zimbabwe success in the elections scheduled for the 29th of March.  "
"5410",2008,"Mbeki","Our multifaceted relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo will continue, as we seek to contribute to the efforts of the sister people of that country to attain lasting peace, and implement their reconstruction and development programme.  "
"5411",2008,"Mbeki","Our government will remain seized of the processes under way in Kenya, Chad, Burundi, Darfur in the Sudan, Western Sahara, CÁ´te d'Ivoire, Somalia, the Comoros and the Central African Republic to find lasting peace and stability.  "
"5412",2008,"Mbeki","We are particularly concerned by the senseless violence and killings in both Kenya and Chad, developments that clearly set back the progress we have been making in the last few years with regard to the regeneration of the African continent. "
"5413",2008,"Mbeki","We call on all African compatriots to do whatever we can, together to help bring a stop to all these negative developments.  "
"5414",2008,"Mbeki","We will, of course, continue to carry out our tasks in the United Nations Security Council. "
"5415",2008,"Mbeki","Critical in this regard, is the strengthening of co-operation between the UN Security Council and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union.  "
"5416",2008,"Mbeki","Impelled by the desire to promote the improvement in the quality of life of all peoples, particularly in the developing countries, we shall focus on further strengthening our participation in the India-Brazil-South Africa forums, the New Africa-Asia Strategic Partnership, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and negotiations to complete the SACU-Mercusor trade agreement.  "
"5417",2008,"Mbeki","In the same measure, we shall continue to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and ongoing improvements in this regard, and in giving further impetus to the negotiations on the WTO Doha Development Round.  "
"5418",2008,"Mbeki","This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Africa and the People's Republic of China. "
"5419",2008,"Mbeki","The mushrooming of relations in a variety of areas between our governments and peoples confirms that the China-South Africa Partnership for Growth and Development is a strategic relationship of mutual benefit, which can only grow from strength to strength.  "
"5420",2008,"Mbeki","Next year, South Africa will play host to the Review Conference to evaluate the implementation of the decisions of the World Conference Against Racism which was held in our country in 2001. "
"5421",2008,"Mbeki","We are confident that, informed by their abhorrence of the scourge of racism and the devastating consequences it continues to exact on humanity, the governments and peoples of the world will work together with us to ensure that the Review Conference achieves its objectives.  "
"5422",2008,"Mbeki","These global responsibilities, including the hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup, bring out in even bolder relief the confidence that humanity has in our country as a strategic player in the noble endeavours of all humanity. "
"5423",2008,"Mbeki","But we should not take this for granted.  "
"5424",2008,"Mbeki","I am confident that, under the leadership of the International Marketing Council, Trade and Investment South Africa (TISA), Tourism South Africa and other agencies we shall all put our hands on deck to communicate to the rest of the world the spirit of Business Unusual, and our continuing advance towards the creation of a society that cares and the conditions for the world to gather in our country to celebrate Africa's humanity in 2010.  "
"5425",2008,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, Chairperson and Honourable Members;  Having said all that I have said, I come back to the question: what is the state of our nation as we enter 2008!  "
"5426",2008,"Mbeki","What I do know and hereby make bold to say is: whatever the challenges of the moment, we are still on course!  "
"5427",2008,"Mbeki","I say this with unshakeable conviction because I am certain that South Africans are capable and geared to meet the challenge of history – to strain every sinew of our being – to respond to the national challenges of the day, including those relating to our economy, the political and economic situation in Africa and elsewhere in the world, and seize the opportunities that our country's progress over the last fourteen years has provided.  "
"5428",2008,"Mbeki","With all hands on deck, and committed to conduct our business in an unusual and more effective fashion, we shall sustain the process of our reconstruction and development and take it to even higher levels.  "
"5429",2008,"Mbeki","Thank you."
"5430",2007,"Mbeki"," Madam Speaker of the National Assembly; Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP; Deputy President of the Republic; Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament; Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary; Heads of our Security Services; Governor of the Reserve Bank; President Nelson Mandela and Madame Graca Machel; President F.W. de Klerk and Madame Elita de Klerk; Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces; Mayors and leaders in our system of local government; Our honoured traditional leaders; Heads of the state organs supporting our constitutional democracy; Directors-General and other leaders of the public service; Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners; Distinguished guests, friends and comrades; People of South Africa:  When she died, we knew that Mama Adelaide Tambo had been recently discharged from hospital. "
"5431",2007,"Mbeki","But because we also knew that she had the tenacity of spirit and strength of will to soldier on among the living, we had intended to welcome her and other members of her family as our guests on this august occasion. "
"5432",2007,"Mbeki","But that was not to be.  "
"5433",2007,"Mbeki","Tomorrow we will pay her our last respects as we inter her remains. "
"5434",2007,"Mbeki","Thus she will only be with us in spirit when in October this year, we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of her husband, the father of her children, her companion, her comrade, and an eminent son of our people, Oliver Reginald Tambo. "
"5435",2007,"Mbeki","Once more, we convey our condolences to the Tambo family.  "
"5436",2007,"Mbeki","However, I am indeed very pleased to acknowledge in our midst this morning the Hon Albertina Luthuli, daughter of our first Nobel Peace Laureate, Inkosi Albert Luthuli, whose tragic death 40 years ago we commemorate this year, remembering the tragic day when it was reported that he had been crushed by a speeding train in the cane-fields of KwaDukuza. "
"5437",2007,"Mbeki","His death was as shocking and mysterious as his life was a lodestar pointing us to the freedom we enjoy today.  "
"5438",2007,"Mbeki","I feel immensely proud that democratic South Africa has had the sense and sensitivity to acknowledge what Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo mean to our nation by naming two of our National Orders after them - the Order of Luthuli, and the Order of the Companions of O.R. "
"5439",2007,"Mbeki","Tambo. "
"5440",2007,"Mbeki","I also know of the great pride felt by those who have been admitted into the ranks of the eminent National Orders.  "
"5441",2007,"Mbeki","I am also pleased to welcome to the House the activists of the 1956 Women’s March and the 1976 Soweto Uprising who are sitting in the President’s box, as well as the eminent patriots from all our provinces, proposed by our Provincial Speakers to join the group of important guests who have joined us today.  "
"5442",2007,"Mbeki","The government of the people of South Africa on whose behalf I speak here today, as I have been privileged to do in previous years, was formed in 2004, after the General Elections of that year.  "
"5443",2007,"Mbeki","At its annual January Lekgotla or Bosberaad last month, the National Cabinet that stands at the pinnacle of the system of governance over which we are privileged to preside, reflected on the fact that its meeting marked the mid-term of the life of the government born of our last, 2004, elections.  "
"5444",2007,"Mbeki","Having understood this, it was natural that we should put the question to ourselves – what progress have we made in the quest to achieve the objectives to which we honestly told the nation we were committed, as a result of which our people gave us the overwhelming authority to govern our country from 2004 until the next elections in 2009!  "
"5445",2007,"Mbeki","With your indulgence, I would like to step further back, and recall what we said, in 2004, as representatives of our people, in the presence of our friends from the rest of the world, convened at our seat of government the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Freedom Day, the 10th anniversary of our liberation, and participated in the Inauguration of the President of the Republic, whom our Parliament had chosen, respecting the will of the people democratically demonstrated during the 2004 elections.  "
"5446",2007,"Mbeki","On that occasion we said in part:  “For too long our country contained within it and represented much that is ugly and repulsive in human society”¦  “It was a place in which to be born black was to inherit a lifelong curse. "
"5447",2007,"Mbeki","It was a place in which to be born white was to carry a permanent burden of fear and hidden rage”¦  “It was a place in which squalor, the stench of poverty, the open sewers, the decaying rot, the milling crowds of wretchedness, the unending images of a landscape strewn with carelessly abandoned refuse, assumed an aspect that seemed necessary to enhance the beauty of another world of tidy streets, and wooded lanes, and flowers’ blossoms offsetting the green and singing grass, and birds and houses fit for kings and queens, and lyrical music, and love.  "
"5448",2007,"Mbeki","“It was a place in which to live in some places was to invite others to prey on you or to condemn oneself to prey on others, guaranteed neighbours who could not but fall victim to alcohol and drug stupors that would dull the pain of living, who knew that their lives would not be normal without murder in their midst, and rape and brutal personal wars without a cause.  "
"5449",2007,"Mbeki","“It was a place in which to live in other neighbourhoods was to enjoy safety and security because to be safe was to be protected by high walls, electrified fences, guard dogs, police patrols and military regiments ready to defend those who were our masters, with guns and tanks and aircraft that would rain death on those who would disturb the peace of the masters”¦  “We have gathered here today, on Freedom Day, because in time, our people, together with the billions of human beings across the globe, who are our comrades-in-arms and whom our distinguished guests represent, decided to say – an end to all that! "
"5450",2007,"Mbeki","”¦  “We are greatly encouraged that our General Elections of a fortnight ago confirmed the determination of all our people, regardless of race, colour and ethnicity, to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream”¦  “None of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty. "
"5451",2007,"Mbeki","This relates to everything, from the improvement of the health of our people, to reducing the levels of crime, raising the levels of literacy and numeracy, and opening the doors of learning and culture to all”¦  “We pledge to all the heroes and heroines who sacrificed for our freedom, as well as to you, our friends from the rest of the world, that we will never betray the trust you bestowed on us when you helped to give us the possibility to transform South Africa into a democratic, peaceful, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous country, committed to the noble vision of human solidarity.  "
"5452",2007,"Mbeki","“The work to create that South Africa has begun. "
"5453",2007,"Mbeki","That work will continue during our Second Decade of Freedom.”  "
"5454",2007,"Mbeki","Fifty years before, as they prepared to convene the Congress of the People, which adopted the Freedom Charter, the patriots of the day had said, “Let us speak together, all of us together – African and European, Indian and Coloured ”¦ all the people of South Africa ”¦Let us speak together of freedom. "
"5455",2007,"Mbeki","And of the happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free”.  "
"5456",2007,"Mbeki","We must today renew our pledge, to speak together of freedom, to act in partnership to realise the happiness for all that should come with liberty, to work together to build a South Africa defined by a common dream, to say, together, in action – enough of everything that made our country to contain within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society!  "
"5457",2007,"Mbeki","We must continue to respond to the perspective we spoke of as the present government began its term of office, fully conscious that “none of the great social problems we have to solve is capable of resolution outside the context of the creation of jobs and the alleviation and eradication of poverty”, and therefore that “the struggle to eradicate poverty has been and will continue to be a central part of the national effort to build the new South Africa”.  "
"5458",2007,"Mbeki","Responding to the imperative to move forward as quickly as possible to build the South Africa defined by a common dream, our government committed itself, working with all South Africans, to implement detailed programmes intended:  * to raise the rate of investment in the First Economy;  * to reduce the cost of doing business in our country;  * to promote the growth of the small and medium business sector;  * to speed up the process of skills development;  * to improve our export performance, focussing on services and manufactured goods;  * to increase spending on scientific research and development;  * to implement detailed programmes to respond to the challenges of the Second Economy;  * to implement programmes to ensure broad-based black economic empowerment;  * to continue with programmes to build a social security net to meet the objectives of poverty alleviation;  * to expand access to such services as water, electricity and sanitation;  * to improve the health profile of the nation as a whole;  * to intensify the housing programme;  * to implement additional measures to open wider the doors of learning and of culture;  * to improve the safety and security of all citizens and communities;  * to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities as a critical player in the growth, reconstruction and development of our country;  * to accelerate the process of renewal of the African continent; and  * increasingly to contribute to the resolution of major questions facing peoples of the world.  "
"5459",2007,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Chairperson;  I am happy to report that with regard to each of these commitments, government remains hard at work to ensure that the nation’s objectives are met.  "
"5460",2007,"Mbeki","At an average of over 4,5%, the rate of growth of our economy over the past two and half years has been at its highest since we attained our democracy in 1994. "
"5461",2007,"Mbeki","Investment in the economy, by both the public and private sectors has been increasing at about 11%, with overall public sector infrastructure spending increasing by an annual average of 15,8%. "
"5462",2007,"Mbeki","Today, fixed investment as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product – at about 18,4% – is at its highest since 1991.  "
"5463",2007,"Mbeki","The number of employed people has been increasing at about half-a-million a year in the past three years.  "
"5464",2007,"Mbeki","We have seen steady progress in the advancement of Black people in the economy. "
"5465",2007,"Mbeki","From owning just over 3% of the market capitalisation of the JSE in 2004, this has increased to close on to 5%; and the proportion of Blacks in top management has grown from 24% of the total to 27%. "
"5466",2007,"Mbeki","Yet we must remain concerned that these figures are still woefully low.  "
"5467",2007,"Mbeki","The advances in the economy have thrown up major challenges for all of us. "
"5468",2007,"Mbeki","The massive and sustained increase in consumer demand reflects a healthy growth in levels of prosperity across the population; and the major infrastructure projects that we are embarking on demand massive input of supplies and machinery.  "
"5469",2007,"Mbeki","But our international trade balance shows that we have not succeeded in building the capacity to produce the consumer and capital goods that our country needs. "
"5470",2007,"Mbeki","While household debt has increased broadly at the same rate as growth in income, the fact that South Africans are saving less means that we have to depend on savings from other nations. "
"5471",2007,"Mbeki","The continuing occasional volatility of our currency has also not boded well for our export industries.  "
"5472",2007,"Mbeki","Over the past three years, the economy has created some one-and-half million jobs. "
"5473",2007,"Mbeki","It is encouraging that in the year March 2005 to March 2006 alone, 300 000 of the jobs created were in the formal sector outside of agriculture, representing a growth rate of about 4%.  "
"5474",2007,"Mbeki","A small part of these are the permanent job opportunities created through the Expanded Public Works Programme. "
"5475",2007,"Mbeki","But there is no question that this programme can and must be ratcheted upwards quite significantly. "
"5476",2007,"Mbeki","There is also no question that we can do much better to create self-employment through small and micro-enterprises. "
"5477",2007,"Mbeki","And given that a large majority of the unemployed are youth, we can do much better in terms of such interventions as the National Youth Service and the development of young entrepreneurs.  "
"5478",2007,"Mbeki","It is a matter of pride that, in line with our commitment to build a caring society, we have since 2004 improved service provision and other aspects of the social wage. "
"5479",2007,"Mbeki","While beneficiaries of social grants numbered about 8 million in 2004, today 11 million poor South Africans have access to these grants. "
"5480",2007,"Mbeki","It is encouraging that the rates of increase in uptake have, in the recent period, been within manageable ranges, as the programmes reach maturity. "
"5481",2007,"Mbeki","This will ensure sustainability, and employment of more government resources to provide economic services to create more jobs and business opportunities.  "
"5482",2007,"Mbeki","The housing programme has seen close to 300 000 new subsidies allocated in the past two years. "
"5483",2007,"Mbeki","However, as we sought to improve quality and develop plans for those who are being missed by the public and private sector programmes currently under way, the pace of roll-out has been much slower than we expected. "
"5484",2007,"Mbeki","We must act to change this situation.  "
"5485",2007,"Mbeki","As Honourable members are aware, we have over the past few years developed and started implementing various programmes aimed at improving passenger transport. "
"5486",2007,"Mbeki","These include the taxi recapitalisation programme and provincial initiatives such as the Moloto Rail Corridor in Mpumalanga around which feasibility work has started, the Klipfontein Corridor in Cape Town and the Gautrain project with its linkages to the rest of the public transport system.  "
"5487",2007,"Mbeki","These and many other initiatives form part of a comprehensive passenger transport strategy, combining both road and rail. "
"5488",2007,"Mbeki","We will attend to the urgent implementation of these programmes to improve the quality of life of especially the working people.  "
"5489",2007,"Mbeki","Access to electricity, water and sanitation has improved. "
"5490",2007,"Mbeki","By 2005, South Africa had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal in respect of basic water supply, with improvement of access from 59% in 1994 to 83% in 2006. "
"5491",2007,"Mbeki","According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), South Africa is one of the few countries that spend less on military budgets than on water and sanitation. "
"5492",2007,"Mbeki","In the words of the UNDP Human Development Report of 2006:  “”¦ South Africa has demonstrated how the human right to water can serve as a mechanism for empowerment and a guide to policy”¦ Rights-based water reform has enabled it to expand access and overcome the legacy of racial inequality inherited from apartheid, partly through rights-based entitlements”. (pp62/63)  We should indeed celebrate this great achievement. "
"5493",2007,"Mbeki","But it is a fact that 8 million people are still without potable water. "
"5494",2007,"Mbeki","Many more are without electricity and sanitation.  "
"5495",2007,"Mbeki","We are proud that within one year, we have been able to reduce the backlog in the eradication of the bucket system in established settlements by almost half. "
"5496",2007,"Mbeki","We are on course to put an end to this dehumanising system in these areas by the end of this year.  "
"5497",2007,"Mbeki","We will continue to confront these challenges so as to erase in our country that which is ugly and repulsive so that together we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty.  "
"5498",2007,"Mbeki","An examination of education and skills acquisition shows improvement of quite a high base by 2004, though at a slow pace. "
"5499",2007,"Mbeki","This applies to literacy levels, gross school enrolment and tertiary participation rates. "
"5500",2007,"Mbeki","The fluctuating Matric pass rates do indicate that much more needs to be done to stabilise the system and ensure steady improvement. "
"5501",2007,"Mbeki","At the same time, the number of Matric students who pass Mathematics at the higher grade is only slightly better than in 1995. "
"5502",2007,"Mbeki","We also continue to show weaknesses in implementing the Adult Basic Education programme.  "
"5503",2007,"Mbeki","While the land restitution programme has resulted in more settlements in the recent period, we still need to put in extra effort in dealing with remaining cases, many of which are much more complex. "
"5504",2007,"Mbeki","On the other hand, very little progress has been made in terms of land redistribution. "
"5505",2007,"Mbeki","We will undertake a careful review of the inhibiting factors so that this programme is urgently speeded up.  "
"5506",2007,"Mbeki","All these economic and social programmes form part of our strategies to reduce and eradicate the poverty that continues to afflict many of our people. "
"5507",2007,"Mbeki","The work done during the course of last year, by women through the South African Women in Dialogue working with various government departments, including a visit to countries such as Tunisia and Chile where great progress has been made in dealing with poverty, does point to some defects in our systems in this regard. "
"5508",2007,"Mbeki","From the experience of this delegation it is clear that we must among other things:  * Define clearly the poverty matrix of our country;  * Develop a proper database of households living in poverty;  * Identify and implement specific interventions relevant to these households;  * Monitor progress in these households as the programmes take effect in graduating them out of poverty;  * In this context, address all indigence, especially the high numbers of women so affected;  * Co-ordinate and align all anti-poverty programmes to maximise impact and avoid wastage and duplication; and,  * Accelerate the training of Family Social Workers at professional and auxiliary levels to ensure that identified households are properly supported and monitored.  "
"5509",2007,"Mbeki","This will ensure the systematic linkage of beneficiaries of social assistance to municipal services and work opportunities, continuously focused on the task to ensure that as many of our people as possible graduate out of dependence on social grants and enter the labour market. "
"5510",2007,"Mbeki","In the meantime, we will continue to explore new initiatives which will progressively improve the social wage.  "
"5511",2007,"Mbeki","A critical leg of these social interventions should be the intensification of joint efforts among all South Africans to improve social cohesion.  "
"5512",2007,"Mbeki","In this year of the 60th anniversary of the Doctors Pact of leaders of African and Indian communities (AB Xuma, GM Naicker and Yusuf Dadoo), the 30th anniversary of the murder of Steve Biko and the 20th anniversary of the visit to Dakar by Afrikaner intellectuals to meet the ANC, the issue of our variety of identities and the overarching sense of belonging to South Africa needs to be better canvassed across society, in a manner that strengthens our unity as a nation. "
"5513",2007,"Mbeki","Further, on this the 30th anniversary of the banning of The World and The Weekend World newspapers, we are duty-bound to ask the question - have we all fully internalised our responsibility in building social cohesion and promoting a common sense of belonging, reinforcing the glue that holds our nation together!  "
"5514",2007,"Mbeki","In other words, measures required to improve social cohesion cannot be undertaken by government alone. "
"5515",2007,"Mbeki","We must together as South Africans speak of freedom from want and from moral decay, and work to attain the happiness that comes with it.  "
"5516",2007,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Chairperson;  I am certain that we shall all agree that working together to achieve the happiness that comes with freedom applies equally to the challenge of dealing with crime. "
"5517",2007,"Mbeki","In the 1994 RDP White Paper we said:  “Promoting peace and security will involve all people. "
"5518",2007,"Mbeki","It will build on and expand the national drive for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities”¦with special attention to the various forms of violence to which women are subjected”¦  “Peace and political stability are also central to the government’s efforts to create an enabling environment to encourage investment”¦Decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness, drug trafficking, gun running, crime and especially the abuse of women and children.”  "
"5519",2007,"Mbeki","Certainly, we cannot erase that which is ugly and repulsive and claim the happiness that comes with freedom if communities live in fear, closeted behind walls and barbed wire, ever anxious in their houses, on the streets and on our roads, unable freely to enjoy our public spaces. "
"5520",2007,"Mbeki","Obviously, we must continue and further intensify the struggle against crime.  "
"5521",2007,"Mbeki","While we have already surpassed that targeted figure of 152 000 police officers employed in the South African Police Service, and while we have improved the training programme, we recognise the fact that the impact of this is not yet high enough for everybody to feel a better sense of safety and security. "
"5522",2007,"Mbeki","While we have reduced the incidence of most contact crimes, the annual reduction rate with regard to such categories as robbery, assault and murder is still below the 7-10% that we had targeted. "
"5523",2007,"Mbeki","And the abuse of women and children continues at an unacceptable level.  "
"5524",2007,"Mbeki","The increase in the incidence of particular crimes during the security workers’ strike should have brought home to all of us the fact that the security industry cannot be handled simply as a private affair of the private sector. "
"5525",2007,"Mbeki","Quite clearly the regulatory system that we have in place is inadequate. "
"5526",2007,"Mbeki","This applies to such issues as wage levels, personnel vetting systems, enforcement of guidelines on cash-delivery vehicles, and so on.  "
"5527",2007,"Mbeki","This is a matter that we shall review during the course of the year, so that, in addition to improving the work of the police, we can together with the private security industry create an environment in which the security expectations of the public, in which huge resources are expended, are actually met.  "
"5528",2007,"Mbeki","We will also continue to put more effort into improving the functioning of our courts, to increase the rate of reduction in case backlogs. "
"5529",2007,"Mbeki","And we will ensure that decisions to expand the Correctional Services infrastructure, improve the management of Border Control as well as the immigration and documentation services, among others, are implemented.  "
"5530",2007,"Mbeki","Many of the weaknesses in improving services to the population derive in part from inadequate capacity and systems to monitor implementation. "
"5531",2007,"Mbeki","As such, in the period leading up to 2009, the issue of the organisation and capacity of the state will remain high on our agenda.  "
"5532",2007,"Mbeki","What has emerged, among others, as a critical area for strategic intervention is the content of training that public servants receive in various institutions and the role of the SA Management Development Institute (SAMDI) which in actual fact should be the major service provider including in the mass induction of public servants.  "
"5533",2007,"Mbeki","Compliance levels within departments, in relation to public service and finance management legislation, have been somewhat mixed. "
"5534",2007,"Mbeki","Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue, even if we take into account the correct observation that auditing requirements at national and provincial levels have become more stringent. "
"5535",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, the application of the performance agreement system particularly for senior management is crucial.  "
"5536",2007,"Mbeki","Programmes to improve the capacity of our local government system continue apace. "
"5537",2007,"Mbeki","Immediately after the March 2006 local government elections, induction programmes were conducted, taking into account that 62% of the mayors are new.  "
"5538",2007,"Mbeki","What is of concern, though, is that in many of these municipalities, many vacancies remain or have emerged in senior management and the professions. "
"5539",2007,"Mbeki","For instance, in September last year, 27% of municipalities did not have municipal managers; in the Northwest Province, the vacancy rate at senior management level was over 50%; and in Mpumalanga only 1% of senior managers had concluded Key Performance Agreements.  "
"5540",2007,"Mbeki","We continue to respond to these challenges and will undertake all necessary tasks, informed by our Five Year Local Government Strategic Agenda, which includes hands-on assistance to municipalities by national and provincial structures, the deployment of skilled personnel including professional volunteers from the public, and strengthening the Ward Committees – 80% of which have been established across the country.  "
"5541",2007,"Mbeki","The programme to align planning instruments across the spheres of government (that is, the National Spatial Development Perspective, Provincial Growth and Development Strategies and Integrated Development Plans) is continuing, with pilot projects for complete alignment being run in 13 of our districts and metros. "
"5542",2007,"Mbeki","These pilot projects should be completed by the end of this year.  "
"5543",2007,"Mbeki","It is a matter of proud record that over half of the districts and metros have held their Growth and Development Summits, and the rest intend to complete this process by the end of February. "
"5544",2007,"Mbeki","This will lay the basis for co-operation among all social partners in speeding up local economic development.  "
"5545",2007,"Mbeki","Honourable Members;  I would like to take advantage of this occasion to express my gratitude to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka for the inspiring leadership she has given to the implementation of the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative (AsgiSA), working with the Ministers and Premiers who constitute the Task Team, concretely addressing very specific issues that need to be done to ensure higher rates of investment and labour-absorption, as well as matters pertaining to skills development and the efficiency of the state system. "
"5546",2007,"Mbeki","We highly appreciate the contribution of all Members of the Executive and our public service managers, across the three spheres of government, in leading this process and in implementing the government programme as a whole. "
"5547",2007,"Mbeki","This is central to our efforts to erase that which is ugly and repulsive in our society so that we can speak of freedom and the happiness that comes with liberty.  "
"5548",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, in order further to speed up the implementation of AsgiSA, over and above the multi-year programmes announced in the recent past, government will this year:  * complete the process of reviewing the country’s experience in the articulation among such macro-economic indicators as the Exchange Rate, inflation and interest rates, so as to put in place measures that will facilitate the growth of industries which produce tradables for both the domestic and export markets, and have the potential to absorb large pools of semi-skilled workers;  * in line with the National Industrial Policy Framework which has now been completed, we will:  - intensify implementation of customised sector measures to facilitate investments in Business Process Outsourcing, tourism, bio-fuels and chemicals, and finalise practical programmes for forestry and paper, clothing and textiles, metals and engineering;  - develop an overarching strategy to prioritise key interventions in mining and mineral beneficiation, agriculture and agro-processing, the white goods sector, creative industries, community and social services and pharmaceuticals. "
"5549",2007,"Mbeki","This must include a determined drive to increase our national capacity to produce capital goods. "
"5550",2007,"Mbeki","With regard to mineral beneficiation for instance, we will set up a State Diamond Trader that will purchase 10% of diamonds from local producers and sell them to local cutters and producers. "
"5551",2007,"Mbeki","We are happy that DeBeers has agreed to assist free of charge with management, technical skills and asset provision for a period of three years;  - develop programmes to facilitate investments in sectors along the supply chain for our infrastructure programmes, including capital goods in ICT, transport and energy: with regard to energy, we will also expedite our work to ensure greater reliance on nuclear power generation, natural gas and the various forms of renewable sources of energy. "
"5552",2007,"Mbeki","With regard to communications, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Communications together with the mobile telephone companies and Telkom are finalising plans to address call termination rates this year for the benefit of all consumers. "
"5553",2007,"Mbeki","In addition, Telkom will apply a special low rate for international bandwidth to 10 development call centres each employing 1000 persons, as part of the effort to expand the BPO sector. "
"5554",2007,"Mbeki","These centres will be established in areas identified by government. "
"5555",2007,"Mbeki","The special rate will be directly comparable to those for the same service and capacity per month offered in any of the comparable countries.  "
"5556",2007,"Mbeki","* We will also take a variety of steps to improve competition in the economy, among others to lower the cost of doing business and promote investment, including practical introduction of the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) system, developing high-speed national and international broadband capacity, finalising the plan to improve the capacity of the rail and port operators, and strengthening the effectiveness of our competition authorities.  "
"5557",2007,"Mbeki","The progress we have made with regard to the recapitalisation of Further Education and Training (FET) Colleges has created the possibility for us significantly to expand the number of available artisans. "
"5558",2007,"Mbeki","Starting this year, resources will be allocated to provide financial assistance to trainees in need, who enter these institutions. "
"5559",2007,"Mbeki","At the same time, we shall urgently resolve the issue of responsibilities between the national and provincial spheres in the management of the FET system. "
"5560",2007,"Mbeki","We do hope that our efforts to promote this area of opportunity will help send the message especially to our young people, that artisan skills are as critical for economic growth as other levels of qualification.  "
"5561",2007,"Mbeki","After intense interaction between government and leaders of our universities, agreement has been reached and decisions taken on the resources required to ensure that the skills in short supply are provided.  "
"5562",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, we wish to commend the role played by the Joint Initiative on Skills Acquisition (JIPSA), which brings together government, business, labour, training institutes and others.  "
"5563",2007,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members know, we have also significantly increased the number of non-fee paying schools.  "
"5564",2007,"Mbeki","In carrying out this infrastructure and other programmes we will be informed by our commitment to ensure that the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the best ever. "
"5565",2007,"Mbeki","We wish in this regard to congratulate our Local Organising Committee (LOC) and other partners for the sterling work they are doing.  "
"5566",2007,"Mbeki","Quite clearly, in order to ensure that all South Africans enjoy the happiness that comes with a growing economy, these and other measures will need to be accompanied by an intensified programme to address challenges in the Second Economy. "
"5567",2007,"Mbeki","Because of this, during the course of this year, we will among other things:  * take further practical action to improve access to micro-finance including the reach of the Apex Fund (SAMAF) and the agricultural micro-credit fund (MAFISA);  * ensure the proper functioning of the Small Enterprises Development Agency, SEDA;  * process the Companies Bill, adopted for public comment by Cabinet last Wednesday, as part of the battery of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small, medium and micro-enterprises and to empower minority shareholders and employees;  * having surpassed the 10 000 target we set ourselves, we will increase the number of young people engaged in the National Youth Service by at least 20 000 through 18 of our departments which have already developed plans in this regard, enrol 30 000 young volunteers in community development initiatives, and employ 5 000 young people as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme in the maintenance of government buildings;  * intensify efforts to integrate youth development into the mainstream of government work, including a youth co-operatives programme, and the ongoing efforts to link unemployed graduates with employment opportunities – and in this regard we wish to thank the many companies, public and private, big and small, which have responded in a splendid and practical manner to this initiative; and,  * start implementing the Communal Land Rights Act in order to improve economic utilisation of communal land, while at the same time expanding assistance such as irrigation, seeds and implements to small and co-operative farmers.  "
"5568",2007,"Mbeki","Honourable Members;  The economic programmes to which we have referred form part of the concerted drive in which all of South Africa should engage in order to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality in our society. "
"5569",2007,"Mbeki","For us it is not a mere cliché to assert that the success of our democracy should and will be measured by the concrete steps we take to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society.  "
"5570",2007,"Mbeki","In order to improve on the social programmes that we have implemented over the years, we aim this year to complete the work already started to reform our system of social security so that phased implementation can start as early as possible. "
"5571",2007,"Mbeki","A critical part of this reform will be the task of repairing a defect identified in the 2002 Report of the Committee of Inquiry into a Comprehensive System of Social Security in South Africa. "
"5572",2007,"Mbeki","This is that the contributory earnings-related pillar of our social security system is missing or unreliable for large numbers of working people. "
"5573",2007,"Mbeki","The principle guiding this approach is that, over and above social assistance provided through the government budget, we need to explore the introduction of an earnings-related contributory social security system that is informed by the principle of social solidarity.  "
"5574",2007,"Mbeki","This will mean that all South Africans will enjoy membership of a common, administratively efficient social insurance system, while those earning higher incomes will be able to continue contributing to private retirement and insurance schemes. "
"5575",2007,"Mbeki","In the discussions thus far conducted within government, consensus is emerging that elements of this system would need to include:  * continuation of the minimum benefits contained in our social grants system with the benefits paid through a modern administrative system;  * a wage subsidy for low-wage employees, possibly directed at first entrants into the job market, especially young people; and  * a social security tax to finance basic retirement savings, death, disability and unemployment benefits.  "
"5576",2007,"Mbeki","The Minister of Finance will further elaborate on these issues in the Budget Speech. "
"5577",2007,"Mbeki","What we should underline though is that in finishing the new social security dispensation, government will undertake a comprehensive process of consultation with all social partners both individually and through NEDLAC.  "
"5578",2007,"Mbeki","In addition, we have also started examining measures to reach vulnerable children over the age of 14 years.  "
"5579",2007,"Mbeki","Our programme in the social sector for this year will also include:  * speeding up of the construction of low-cost housing which will require the urgent establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle to handle finances, piloting of the Land Use Management Bill and ensuring that the remaining elements of the much-delayed agreement with the private sector on low-cost housing are finalised;  * speeding up the implementation of the taxi recapitalisation project, implementing detailed plans for passenger rail and road transport including the Bus Rapid Transit System in the Metros and recapitalisation of Metrorail: and in this regard, let me take this opportunity to emphasise that government and our partners in SANTACO will not be bullied into abandoning the taxi recapitalisation project, and any attempts to undermine public order in pursuit of selfish interests will be dealt with accordingly;  * expanding access to Early Childhood Development both as part of the programme to improve the general education system and as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme;  * expanding training and employment of nurses and social workers as well as auxiliaries, increasing the number of training institutions, improving the quality of training, and instituting a bursary system;  * continuing with the implementation of the remuneration dispensation for medical professionals, and providing additional resources further to improve the remuneration levels of teachers;  * ensuring the implementation, without further delay, of measures to reduce the cost of medicines; and  * continuing work to address especially the various non-natural causes of death in our society as well as lifestyle diseases, malaria, the various strains of TB, road accidents and violent crime.  "
"5580",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and AIDS and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention, home-based care and treatment. "
"5581",2007,"Mbeki","We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened, and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against AIDS and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible.  "
"5582",2007,"Mbeki","This year we shall complete concrete plans on implementation of the final stages of our programmes to meet the targets for universal access to water in 2008, sanitation in 2010 and electricity in 2012. "
"5583",2007,"Mbeki","We shall also finalise the strategy and programmes to address matters of social cohesion, including the comprehensive and integrated anti-poverty strategy we have mentioned, as well as address issues pertaining to national unity, value systems and identity.  "
"5584",2007,"Mbeki","All these efforts, Madame Speaker and Chairperson, must go hand in hand with a sustained drive to improve community safety and security. "
"5585",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, government will ensure that the decisions already taken about strengthening our fight against crime are effectively implemented. "
"5586",2007,"Mbeki","The challenge that we face in addressing this issue has little to do with policies.  "
"5587",2007,"Mbeki","Rather, what is required is effective organisation, mobilisation and leadership of the mass of law-enforcement, intelligence and corrections officers, and functionaries of the justice system. "
"5588",2007,"Mbeki","The overwhelming majority of these public servants have proven over and over again in actual practice that they are prepared to put their lives on the line and to sacrifice even the little quality time they could have with their families, in defence of our freedom and our security.  "
"5589",2007,"Mbeki","In addition to the many ongoing programmes that we have been implementing, government will this year:  * continue to improve the remuneration and working conditions of the police, and start the process of further expanding the personnel of the South African Police Service to bring their total number to over 180 000 within three years, and ensure optimal utilisation of the electronic monitoring and evaluation system that has just been introduced;  * bring to full capacity the forensic laboratories which have been equipped with the latest technology, and ensure the optimum utilisation of the finger-print database – indeed, many of the recent successes in solving serious crime incidents have been facilitated by these systems;  * bring the operations of the Department of Home Affairs to full capacity, by filling vacant posts, improving systems and implementing other recommendations of the Task Team that has been working with the Minister to improve the work of this vital institution;  * implement the recommendations of the Khampepe Commission on the mandate and operations of the Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions);  * start the process of further modernising the systems of the South African Revenue Services, especially in respect of border control, and improve the work of the inter-departmental co-ordinating structures in this regard;  * intensify intelligence work with regard to organised crime, building on the successes that have been achieved in the last few months in dealing with cash-in-transit heists, drug trafficking and poaching of game and abalone;  * utilise to maximum effect the new technology that has been provided to the justice system and generally improve management of the courts and the prosecution service, in order massively to reduce case backlogs;  * finalise remaining elements of measures to transform the judiciary and improve its functioning, in consultation with this eminent institution of our democracy;  * implement the programmes decided upon to build more corrections facilities and realise the objectives of the White Paper on Corrections;  * continue with the processes further to capacitate our intelligence agencies, and ensure that at all times they operate within the framework of our Constitution and laws; and  * improve our analysis of crime trends to improve our performance with regard both to crime prevention and crime combating. "
"5590",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, we must respond to the cold reality that, as in other countries, the overwhelming majority of violent crimes against the person occur in the most socio-economically deprived areas of our country and require strong and sustained community interventions focused on crime prevention.  "
"5591",2007,"Mbeki","As we have already said, these and other measures will succeed only if we build an enduring partnership in actual practice within our communities and between the communities and the police, to make life more and more difficult for the criminals.  "
"5592",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, we are heartened by the resolve shown by leaders of the business and religious communities further to strengthen such partnerships on the ground, and to give of their time and resources to strengthen the fight against crime. "
"5593",2007,"Mbeki","Government will play its part to ensure that these partnerships actually work, and that we all act together to discharge the responsibility to protect our citizens.  "
"5594",2007,"Mbeki","I should mention in this regard that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the Police Service are working on proposals further to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the vitally important Community Police Forums.  "
"5595",2007,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Chairperson;  Further to improve its service to the people, government should optimise its capacity and organisational efficiency. "
"5596",2007,"Mbeki","To achieve these objectives, we will during the course of this year:  * strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity across all the spheres, including training of managers responsible for the implementation of this system;  * complete, within the next 18 months, legislation on a single public service and relevant norms and standards, remuneration policy and matters pertaining to medical aid and pensions;  * intensify outreach and awareness on issues of national spatial development, while increasing the number of municipalities involved in the harmonisation of planning instruments across the three spheres;  * conduct capacity assessments and implement interventions in Provincial Departments responsible for local government, as well as the Offices of the Premiers, while continuing to improve the capacity of our national departments;  * while intensifying the public sector and national anti-corruption campaign, complete by the end of the year the process further to improve the effectiveness of our anti-corruption strategies for all spheres of government;  * roll out the Batho Pele campaign at local government level, intensify outreach activities including izimbizo and set up more Multi-Purpose Community Centres beyond the 90 currently operational; and,  * further capacitate and provide more support to the institution of traditional leadership.  "
"5597",2007,"Mbeki","Improving governance also means having a sound statistical database about social dynamics within our nation. "
"5598",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard, two major surveys will be undertaken in 2007. "
"5599",2007,"Mbeki","As of two days ago 6 000 field workers from Statistics South Africa have gone out across our country to collect information on 280 000 households chosen to participate in a Community Survey, which will give government as accurate as possible a snapshot of the circumstances of citizens in every part of the country.  "
"5600",2007,"Mbeki","In October another 30 000 individuals in 8 000 households will be selected to participate in South Africa's first national panel study, the National Income Dynamics Study. "
"5601",2007,"Mbeki","These 30 000 individuals will be tracked over time, to further our understanding of such issues such as migration, labour market transitions, inter-generational mobility and household formation and dissolution. "
"5602",2007,"Mbeki","I wish to take this opportunity to call on all those selected to cooperate fully in these important undertakings.  "
"5603",2007,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Chairperson:  Among the greatest achievements of the peoples of Africa in the past two-and-half years has been the restoration of peace in the Great Lakes Region. "
"5604",2007,"Mbeki","We are proud, as South Africans, of the role that our people have played in helping to bring this about – from the young men and women in our National Defence Force to employees of public and private institutions who gave of their time to ensure that the African dream finds practical realisation in the homeland of Patrice Lumumba.  "
"5605",2007,"Mbeki","We will continue to work with the sister people of the DRC, as well as Burundi, the Comoros and Sudan in particular to ensure that the condition of peace and stability thus far attained translates without pause into concerted action for economic reconstruction and social development.  "
"5606",2007,"Mbeki","However, while we are fully justified in celebrating the achievements that Africa has made in her endeavour to achieve peace and development, we cannot underplay the challenges that we face in dealing with the remaining areas of conflict, particularly the general peace process in Sudan, including the situation in Darfur, CÁ´te d’Ivoire and Somalia.  "
"5607",2007,"Mbeki","Our government will respond appropriately and as our capacity permits, to the call of the African Union for assistance to the people and government of Somalia. "
"5608",2007,"Mbeki","Critical in this regard, are the initiatives under way to ensure that the protagonists within Somalia interact with one another to find a solution that is inclusive and practicable, based on the need to achieve national reconciliation.  "
"5609",2007,"Mbeki","This year the African Peer Review Forum will complete its review of our country. "
"5610",2007,"Mbeki","I wish to take this opportunity to thank our legislators, government Ministers and departments, our civil society organisations and society at large for the contribution they made to an exercise that was as challenging as it was unique for our young democracy. "
"5611",2007,"Mbeki","We will also take the necessary steps to implement the required programme of action that will emerge as a result of the peer review process.  "
"5612",2007,"Mbeki","Similarly, we will continue to work with the rest of our continent and our development partners to speed up the implementation of the NEPAD programmes.  "
"5613",2007,"Mbeki","Just over a month ago, South Africa started its tour of duty as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. "
"5614",2007,"Mbeki","We hereby wish to pledge, on behalf of the people of South Africa, that we will, in this most esteemed of multilateral bodies, do everything necessary further to contribute to international peace and security.  "
"5615",2007,"Mbeki","In this regard we will also continue to engage the leaders of the peoples of Palestine, Israel, Iraq, Iran and other countries in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.  "
"5616",2007,"Mbeki","We shall also continue to strengthen our relations with other countries on the continent, our partners in India, Brazil and the People’s Republic of China, other countries of the South, as well as Japan, Europe and North America.  "
"5617",2007,"Mbeki","One of the critical questions that we shall pursue in this regard is the speedy resumption of the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations. "
"5618",2007,"Mbeki","We are convinced that solutions to the logjams currently being experienced can be found, and that it is in the long-term interest of developed and developing countries alike that these talks should reach fruition.  "
"5619",2007,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, Chairperson and Honourable Members;  Since the popular mandate of 2004, we have made welcome progress in further changing South Africa for the better. "
"5620",2007,"Mbeki","We should not and do not underplay the many difficulties we still confront.  "
"5621",2007,"Mbeki","But the message that our collective experience communicates to all of us is that, working together, we can and shall succeed in meeting the common objective we have set ourselves as a nation - to build a better life for all, in a country that no longer contains within it and represent much that is ugly and repulsive in human society.  "
"5622",2007,"Mbeki","We should today, even more confidently, speak together of freedom. "
"5623",2007,"Mbeki","We should dare to act in concert to pursue the “happiness that can come to men and women if they live in a land that is free”.  "
"5624",2007,"Mbeki","We are not there yet. "
"5625",2007,"Mbeki","But no one, except ourselves, shall ensure that this dream is realised. "
"5626",2007,"Mbeki","And so, let us roll up our sleeves and get down to work, fully understanding that the task to build the South Africa for which we yearn is a common responsibility we all share.  "
"5627",2007,"Mbeki","Thank you."
"5628",2006,"Mbeki"," Madame Speaker of the National Assembly; Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the National Assembly and the NCOP; Deputy President of the Republic; Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament; Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary; Heads of our Security Services; Governor of the Reserve Bank; Mrs Graca Machel; Mr and Ms FW de Klerk and Mr Jacob Zuma; Distinguished Premiers and Speakers of our Provinces; Mayors and leaders in our system of local government; Our honoured traditional leaders; Heads of the state organs supporting our democratic system; Directors-General and other leaders of the public service; Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners; Distinguished guests, friends and comrades; People of South Africa:  First of all I would like to acknowledge and welcome to this occasion some distinguished personalities who are sitting in the gallery of this hallowed chamber. "
"5629",2006,"Mbeki","I refer here to the esteemed Graca Machel whose first husband, the heroic Samora Machel, died in a mysterious plane crash at Mbuzini in Mpumalanga 20 years ago this year.  "
"5630",2006,"Mbeki","I refer also to the Reverend fathers, Revs Mgojo and Xundu, and Yasmin Sooka, who served the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in various capacities, and some of those who petitioned the Commission, to promote the noble cause of peace, truth and reconciliation in our country.  "
"5631",2006,"Mbeki","I refer also to Ella Gandhi, grand-daughter of the irreplaceable Mahatma Gandhi, who 100 years ago here in South Africa, launched Satyagraha, the unique non-violent struggle that liberated India and inspired millions of freedom fighters everywhere else in the world.  "
"5632",2006,"Mbeki","We take this opportunity to remember the martyrs who were brutally assassinated in Matola, as well as the leader of our people Joe Gqabi.  "
"5633",2006,"Mbeki","Present among us also are Inkosi Zondi and Oscar Zondi, patriots from KwaZulu-Natal who are working to ensure that the nation honours the Bambata Rebellion of a century ago in a fitting manner.  "
"5634",2006,"Mbeki","We are also honoured to have in our midst Sophie De Bruyn and others present in the house who were part of the heroic women who marched on the Union Buildings in Pretoria 50 years ago on 9 August 1956, thus placing the women of our country in the frontline of our struggle for national liberation.  "
"5635",2006,"Mbeki","The representatives of the youth that rose up in revolt 30 years ago, in the Soweto Uprising sit everywhere in this House, including the benches of the ruling party, and have therefore had no need to have special representatives sitting in the gallery of this House.  "
"5636",2006,"Mbeki","I am honoured to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of an outstanding human being and friend of our country and people, the leading Indian “Bollywood” actor, Anil Kapoor.  "
"5637",2006,"Mbeki","All of us are deeply moved that Anil Kapoor, a citizen of the beloved land of Mahatma Gandhi, has agreed to serve as one of South Africa’s global brand ambassadors, committed to mobilise the peoples of the world to support our efforts to make a success of our liberation.  "
"5638",2006,"Mbeki","On behalf of our government and all our people, I extend our heartfelt welcome to all these distinguished guests and thank them for honouring our nation today by their presence on this important national occasion.     "
"5639",2006,"Mbeki","Speaking at the very first Annual Regular Opening of our Democratic Parliament, on 24 May 1994, almost a month after the historic April 27th elections in which, for the first time ever, the people of our country freely decided together who should govern our country, the Honourable Nelson Mandela issued an historic challenge that:  “we must, constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.”  "
"5640",2006,"Mbeki","Perhaps what the nation has done and not done during the years of the democratic epoch, that have accumulated since Nelson Mandela delivered the first State of the Nation Address on 24 May 1994, has created the possibility for us to reiterate the call he made on that day to all of us as South Africans, nearly twelve years ago, together “to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.”  "
"5641",2006,"Mbeki","On that day in May 1994, the Hon Nelson Mandela evoked the haunting memory of an extraordinary South African, Ingrid Jonker, who committed suicide just over 40 years ago, in the same sea waters that isolated his former involuntary temporary home, Robben Island, from our mainland, as she was isolated from and by her kith and kin. "
"5642",2006,"Mbeki","Of her he said:  “In the midst of despair, she celebrated hope. "
"5643",2006,"Mbeki","Confronted with death, she asserted the beauty of life. "
"5644",2006,"Mbeki","In the dark days when all seemed hopeless in our country, when many refused to hear her resonant voice, she took her own life.  "
"5645",2006,"Mbeki","“To her and others like her, we owe a debt to life itself. "
"5646",2006,"Mbeki","To her and others like her, we owe a commitment to the poor, the oppressed, the wretched and the despised.”  "
"5647",2006,"Mbeki","Nelson Mandela said that in the aftermath of the massacre at the anti-pass demonstrations in Sharpeville, Langa and Nyanga, she wrote that:  Die kind is nie dood nie  die kind lig sy vuiste teen sy moeder  wat Afrika skreeu…      die kind wat net wou speel in die son by Nyanga als orals  die kind wat 'n man geword het trek deur die ganse Afrika  die kind wat 'n reus geword het reis deur die hele wêreld   Sonder 'n pas   The child is not dead the child lifts his fists against his mother who shouts Africa!...  this child who only wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere the child grown to a man treks on through all Africa the child grown to a giant journeys through the whole world without a pass!  "
"5648",2006,"Mbeki","Nelson Mandela continued:  “And in this glorious vision, (Ingrid Jonker) instructs that our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child. "
"5649",2006,"Mbeki","It is these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government.  "
"5650",2006,"Mbeki","“And so we must, constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.”  "
"5651",2006,"Mbeki","Confronted by this historic challenge, I dare say that no one in our country can, like Shakespeare’s Macbeth, grieve that in the period since that distinguished son of our people, the Honourable Nelson Mandela, delivered our first State of the Nation Address, all we can truthfully say, with Macbeth, about our country’s fate is:  To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death…  Indeed I believe that for many of us, our country’s evolution away from its apartheid past seems to have moved at such a hectic pace that even some of the seminal moments marking the birth of our democracy, that are less than two decades old, present themselves in the subconscious mind as being mere chapters in an aging historical record of a distant past.  "
"5652",2006,"Mbeki","Nothing that has happened during the age of democracy could justify the conclusion, similar to the one that Macbeth arrived at, that any of our yesterdays has only served to guide fools to avoidable catastrophe.  "
"5653",2006,"Mbeki","On the contrary, the age of democracy has given itself moral legitimacy by ensuring that Ingrid Jonker lives on, a heroine to all our people. "
"5654",2006,"Mbeki","The child she knew had not died, despite the apartheid bullet through its head. "
"5655",2006,"Mbeki","And now grown to a giant, treks on through all Africa and the whole world, without a pass!  "
"5656",2006,"Mbeki","This year we will have occasion to remind ourselves of, and celebrate, two of the seminal moments to which I have referred. "
"5657",2006,"Mbeki","One of these is the 15th anniversary of the holding of the first meeting of Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) on 20 December 1991, and the adoption of the vitally important Declaration of Intent the following day. "
"5658",2006,"Mbeki","The other is the 10th anniversary of the adoption of our Constitution on 8 May 1996.  "
"5659",2006,"Mbeki","Among other things, the CODESA Declaration of Intent said:  “We…declare our solemn commitment to bring about an undivided South Africa with one nation sharing a common citizenship, patriotism and loyalty, pursuing amidst our diversity, freedom, equality and security for all irrespective of race, colour, sex or creed; a country free from apartheid or any other form of discrimination or domination.”  "
"5660",2006,"Mbeki","The importance of this particular moment in our history both for our country and the peoples of the world was underlined by the presence at CODESA of international observers from the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Commonwealth.  "
"5661",2006,"Mbeki","In a joint statement, these representatives of important international organisations said: ""CODESA must herald the dawn of a new era of peace and justice. "
"5662",2006,"Mbeki","The broad objectives expressed in the Declaration of Intent are a most constructive and auspicious beginning for CODESA and give promise of attainment of a true democracy for South Africa…We hope that all the representatives of the South African people will join in the rebuilding of their country"".  "
"5663",2006,"Mbeki","Periods of a decade and a decade-and-a-half are but fleeting moments in the life of any nation. "
"5664",2006,"Mbeki","In our case we have lived through these years conscious of the enormous effort it would require of all of us to unshackle our country from the heavy chains that tie it to its past.  "
"5665",2006,"Mbeki","We have known that it would take considerable time before we could say we have eradicated the legacy of the past. "
"5666",2006,"Mbeki","We have expected that the circumstances handed down to us by our history would indeed condemn us to a ‘petty pace’ of progress towards the achievement of the goal of a better life for all.  "
"5667",2006,"Mbeki","And yet today, as I stand here to speak to the Honourable Members of our national, provincial and local legislatures, an important component part of our national political leadership, other echelons of that leadership, and our international guests, I feel emboldened to appropriate for our people the promise contained in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, when God said:  For you shall go out with joy, And be led out in peace; The mountains and the hills Shall break forth into singing before you, And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.  "
"5668",2006,"Mbeki","Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree And instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree…  Kuba niya kuphuma ninovuyo, Nithundezwe ninoxolo. "
"5669",2006,"Mbeki","Iintaba neenduli ziya kugqabhuka Zimemelele phambi kwenu, Imithi yasendle ibethe izandla.  "
"5670",2006,"Mbeki","Esikhundleni somqaqoba kuya kuphuma imisedare, Esikhundleni serhawu kuya kunyuka imirtile…  What has been achieved since Nelson Mandela delivered his first State of the Nation Address, and what we can do, given the larger resources that have since been generated, has surely given hope to the masses of our people, that it is possible for all Africa to hear the mountains and the hills singing before them.  "
"5671",2006,"Mbeki","When he addressed the United Nations General Assembly 14 years ago on 18 February 1992, a mere two months after our nation established CODESA, the then Chairperson of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid said:  “During the next few months, the Special Committee will need to closely monitor developments, in order to identify all factors threatening to derail the process in South Africa and to issue early warnings accordingly. "
"5672",2006,"Mbeki","We will thus pay particular attention to the underlying causes of violence. "
"5673",2006,"Mbeki","The level and the nature of violence continues to be extremely disturbing. "
"5674",2006,"Mbeki","More than 2 600 persons lost their lives in 1991 as a result of politically related violence.”  "
"5675",2006,"Mbeki","Reading this today, wondering what could have gone wrong that so many people had to lose their lives needlessly, it becomes difficult to avoid the conclusion that – yesterday was another country!  "
"5676",2006,"Mbeki","And yet during the very same year that we adopted our Constitution, Amnesty International could still report that:  “At least 500 people were killed in continuing political violence in KwaZulu-Natal; some appeared to have been extra-judicially executed. "
"5677",2006,"Mbeki","Reports of torture and ill-treatment in police custody continued. "
"5678",2006,"Mbeki","Four people were killed by right-wing opponents of the government. "
"5679",2006,"Mbeki","Further evidence emerged, through court proceedings and Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, of official involvement in human rights violations under the former government.”  "
"5680",2006,"Mbeki","Fifteen years ago the international community was expressing deep concern about factors threatening to derail the process in our country towards ending white minority rule, including the violence then claiming too many lives, and found it necessary to appeal to all our people to act together to end apartheid and rebuild the country.  "
"5681",2006,"Mbeki","The peoples of the world could have reiterated their concern about political violence in our country even five years later, as we took the giant step forward by adopting our Constitution.  "
"5682",2006,"Mbeki","Happily, in time, we managed to break free of the uncertainty about a bright future for our country, dramatically represented by the large numbers of people killed throughout the years from 1990 to 1996, when we were engaged in negotiations to establish our democratic order.  "
"5683",2006,"Mbeki","This year opened with the inspiring news that our people were highly optimistic about their future and the future of our country, ranking eighth in the world on the optimism index. "
"5684",2006,"Mbeki","Gallup International, which issued this report, said we have three times more optimists than pessimists, and that the optimism figure had doubled even since 2002.  "
"5685",2006,"Mbeki","This compared sharply with the situation in 1993, when our country was still in the grip of the crisis that had been of so much concern to the international community. "
"5686",2006,"Mbeki","That year, our country had more pessimists than optimists, signifying the prevalence of a mood of despair generated in part by the cold-blooded assassination that year of one of our outstanding leaders, Chris Hani.  "
"5687",2006,"Mbeki","The results obtained by Gallup International have been confirmed by a recent domestic poll conducted by Markinor. "
"5688",2006,"Mbeki","According to this poll, 65% of our people believe that the country is going in the right direction. 84% think that our country holds out a happy future for all racial groups. 71% believe that government is performing well.  "
"5689",2006,"Mbeki","With regard to the economy, late last month the Grant Thornton International Business Owners Survey reported that 80% of South Africa’s business owners are optimistic about the year ahead, making them the third most optimistic internationally. "
"5690",2006,"Mbeki","Again last month, the First National Bank and the Bureau for Economic Research reported that the consumer confidence index is at its highest in 25 years.  "
"5691",2006,"Mbeki","What all these figures signify is that our people are firmly convinced that our country has entered its Age of Hope. "
"5692",2006,"Mbeki","They are convinced that we have created the conditions to achieve more rapid progress towards the realisation of their dreams. "
"5693",2006,"Mbeki","They are certain that we are indeed a winning nation.  "
"5694",2006,"Mbeki","Through our National Effort they can see the relevance to our situation of God’s blessings communicated in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:  For you shall go out with joy, And be led out in peace; The mountains and the hills Shall break forth into singing before you, And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.  "
"5695",2006,"Mbeki","Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress tree And instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree…   The inspiring perspective about our future shared by the majority of our people derives from what our country has achieved first to overcome the obstacles to freedom we faced before 1994, the advances we have made since then to consolidate our democracy, while promoting non-racism and non-sexism, the progress we have made to alleviate the poverty afflicting millions of our people, and the strides we have made to expand and modernise our economy.  "
"5696",2006,"Mbeki","We owe these outstanding achievements to the sterling efforts made by all our people in all walks of life. "
"5697",2006,"Mbeki","To that extent I would like to take the opportunity of this State of the Nation Address to salute and thank all our people for responding to the call made by Nelson Mandela in 1994 from this podium, when he said “we must, constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.”  "
"5698",2006,"Mbeki","Millions did indeed seize the time and, in action, defined ours as a shared destiny of peace, democracy, non-racism, non-sexism, shared prosperity and a better life for all. "
"5699",2006,"Mbeki","It is because of what these millions did that our people know from their own experience that today is better than yesterday, and are confident that tomorrow will be better than today.  "
"5700",2006,"Mbeki","While we must indeed celebrate the high levels of optimism that inspire our people, who are convinced that our country has entered its Age of Hope, we must also focus on and pay particular attention to the implications of those high levels of optimism with regard to what we must do together to achieve the objective of a better life for all our people. "
"5701",2006,"Mbeki","We have to respond to the hopes of the people by doing everything possible to meet their expectations.  "
"5702",2006,"Mbeki","And here I include among those who have to respond to the high expectations of our people not just the government, but also the private sector, the labour unions and the rest of civil society, and patriotic individuals.  "
"5703",2006,"Mbeki","In the period ahead of us, we have to sustain the multi-faceted national effort that enabled us to realise the advances that have inspired so much confidence among our people for a better tomorrow. "
"5704",2006,"Mbeki","On behalf of our government I would therefore like to use this important landmark in our national life to repeat the appeal made by Nelson Mandela 12 years ago, that together “we must…seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.”  "
"5705",2006,"Mbeki","And I dare say that essentially all of us are very familiar with what the people expect, which would confirm that they were not wrong to conclude that our country has entered its Age of Hope.  "
"5706",2006,"Mbeki","The Markinor survey to which we have referred indicates some of the concerns of our people. "
"5707",2006,"Mbeki","Whereas, as we have indicated, 71% believe that government is generally performing well, only 56% think government is responding well to our economic challenges, with the figure dropping to 54% with regard to the cluster of Justice functions.  "
"5708",2006,"Mbeki","We must also note that the government’s approval rating with regard to the economy moves in tandem with the levels of income. "
"5709",2006,"Mbeki","Significantly, 72% approve of the government’s efforts in various areas of social delivery. "
"5710",2006,"Mbeki","In contrast, only 45% believe that the sphere of local government is performing well.  "
"5711",2006,"Mbeki","The Honourable Members will also be pleased to know that a survey conducted by the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) shows that 90% of our population is proud of our country, our flag and National Anthem, while 60% consider Freedom Day, April 27th, as the most important national day.  "
"5712",2006,"Mbeki","The outcomes of these surveys communicate the unequivocal message that our people expect that:  * we should move faster to address the challenges of poverty, underdevelopment and marginalisation confronting those caught within the Second Economy, to ensure that the poor in our country share in our growing prosperity; * we should make the necessary interventions with regard to the First Economy to accelerate progress towards the achievement of higher levels of economic growth and development of at least 6% a year; * we must sustain and improve the effectiveness of our social development programmes targeted at providing a cushion of support to those most exposed to the threat of abject poverty; * we must act more aggressively with regard to our criminal justice system to improve the safety and security of our people, especially by improving the functioning of our courts and increasing our conviction rates to strengthen the message that crime does not pay; * we must ensure that the machinery of government, especially the local government sphere, discharges its responsibilities effectively and efficiently, honouring the precepts of Batho Pele; and, * we must harness the Proudly South African spirit that is abroad among the people to build the strongest possible partnership between all sections of our population to accelerate our advance towards the realisation of the important goal of a better life for all.  "
"5713",2006,"Mbeki","Our government is committed to respond with all necessary seriousness and determination to all these challenges, and play its role to give new content to our Age of Hope. "
"5714",2006,"Mbeki","I am honoured to have this opportunity to announce some of the elements of the programme of our government to honour this commitment.  "
"5715",2006,"Mbeki","The Honourable Members and the country at large are aware that, under the leadership of Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the three spheres of government have been working together for some months to elaborate the specific interventions that will ensure that ASGISA, the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative of South Africa, succeeds in its purposes, which include the reduction of the unemployment levels.  "
"5716",2006,"Mbeki","In this regard I would like to thank the members of the private sector, the trade union movement, women, youth and civil society who have participated in this process, making a valuable input into an important initiative that must be owned and implemented by our people as a whole.  "
"5717",2006,"Mbeki","I must also take advantage of this occasion to explain that ASGISA is not intended to cover all elements of a comprehensive development plan. "
"5718",2006,"Mbeki","Rather it consists of a limited set of interventions that are intended to serve as catalysts to accelerated and shared growth and development.  "
"5719",2006,"Mbeki","Otherwise we will continue to engage the nation and all social partners to address other elements of a comprehensive development plan to improve on our current programmes, and deal with other issues, such as the comprehensive industrial policy, keeping in mind the objective to halve poverty and unemployment by 2014.  "
"5720",2006,"Mbeki","Our government is convinced that favourable conditions exist for us to achieve the accelerated and shared growth to which we are committed. "
"5721",2006,"Mbeki","For instance, on 3 January 2005, the newspaper Business Day commented that:  “In South Africa, this promises to be the dawn of a golden age of growth…We have now had more than five years of sustained growth – an upswing longer than the boom of the 1960s and indeed longer than anything in the postwar period…We are reaping the benefits of years of sound financial and monetary policy as well as of structural reform in the economy.  “…we are set fairer than we have been in decades to raise the growth rate on a sustainable basis. "
"5722",2006,"Mbeki","The trouble is, not all of it is within our control, as much depends on the vagaries of world markets and the global economy…  “But, make no mistake…[T]his economy and this market starts to look very different to anything we are used to. "
"5723",2006,"Mbeki","And it is certainly a different good, not a different bad”.  "
"5724",2006,"Mbeki","We fully agree with these observations, and would add that, that “different good” has included significant job creation, a trend that we seek to enhance through ASGISA and our other development programmes.  "
"5725",2006,"Mbeki","To implement ASGISA, the state-owned enterprises and the public sector as a whole, working in some instances through public-private partnerships, will make large investments in various sectors to:  * meet the demand for electricity; * provide an efficient and competitive logistic infrastructure; * expand and modernise the telecommunications infrastructure; and, * satisfy the demand for water.  "
"5726",2006,"Mbeki","The public sector will also accelerate infrastructure investment in the underdeveloped urban and rural areas of our country through the Municipal Infrastructure Grant, Expanded Public Works Programme and other infrastructure funds to improve service delivery in the areas of the Second Economy, including the provision of: * roads and rail; * water; * energy; * housing, schools and clinics; * business premises and business support centres; * sports facilities; and, * multi-purpose government service centres, including police stations and courts.  "
"5727",2006,"Mbeki","R372 billion will be provided for both these sets of programmes over the next three years.  "
"5728",2006,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members would expect we will continue to pay particular attention to the Expanded Public Works Programme as an important bridge between the two economies and a significant part of our poverty alleviation programme. "
"5729",2006,"Mbeki","Among other things, resources for the public works programmes will be pooled to ensure maximum impact both in terms of products delivered and employment and skills-training opportunities.  "
"5730",2006,"Mbeki","Better supervision of infrastructure projects undertaken by government will be introduced, to ensure that capital budgets are spent without roll-overs and that labour-intensive methods are prioritised, and the necessary training of workers is carried out to provide them with skills.  "
"5731",2006,"Mbeki","ASGISA has also identified particular sectors of our economy for accelerated growth, building on the work already done within the context of our existing Micro-Economic Reform Programme. "
"5732",2006,"Mbeki","These include:  * Business Process Outsourcing; * Tourism; * Chemicals; * Bio-fuels; * Metals and metallurgy; * Wood, pulp and paper; * Agriculture; * The creative industries; and * Clothing and textiles.  "
"5733",2006,"Mbeki","In this regard, work is proceeding apace to address such challenges as the cost of telecommunications, and import parity pricing with regard to steel and chemicals. "
"5734",2006,"Mbeki","We have already reached agreement with the People’s Republic of China to protect our clothing and textile sector. "
"5735",2006,"Mbeki","The second National Telecommunications Operator should become operational later this year.  "
"5736",2006,"Mbeki","For ASGISA to succeed, it is clear that the machinery of state, and especially local government, should function effectively and efficiently. "
"5737",2006,"Mbeki","During the past year, our government has undertaken a detailed assessment to determine what we need to do to improve the capacity of our system of local government.  "
"5738",2006,"Mbeki","As we announced last year, we have been engaged in assessing the capacity of government to discharge its responsibilities to help accelerate the process of social transformation. "
"5739",2006,"Mbeki","Proceeding from the particular to the general, the audit of a number of national departments has been completed.  "
"5740",2006,"Mbeki","These include housing, health, education and trade and industry. "
"5741",2006,"Mbeki","Across all these, issues of skills, vacancies, delegation of responsibilities to managers of delivery agencies and relationship between national and provincial departments have emerged as being among the most critical areas requiring attention. "
"5742",2006,"Mbeki","Assessments of the other departments will be carried out.  "
"5743",2006,"Mbeki","The government will make the necessary interventions to address the issues raised by these assessments, bearing in mind the critical role that government must play as one of our country’s most important developmental agencies. "
"5744",2006,"Mbeki","We cannot allow that government departments become an obstacle to the achievement of the goal of a better life for all because of insufficient attention to the critical issue of effective and speedy delivery of services.  "
"5745",2006,"Mbeki","In this context, we will continue the work towards the creation of one public service covering all spheres of government, fully conscious of the complexity of this matter and the need to secure the agreement of all relevant stakeholders. "
"5746",2006,"Mbeki","We will also continue to pay the necessary attention to the important issues of the inclusion of women and people with disabilities at decision-making levels of the public service.  "
"5747",2006,"Mbeki","Everything we have said so far, concerning ASGISA, points to the inescapable conclusion that, to meet our objectives, we will have to pay particular attention to the issue of scarce skills that will negatively affect the capacity of both the public and the private sectors to meet the goals set by ASGISA.  "
"5748",2006,"Mbeki","In this regard, I would therefore like to assure the Honourable Members and the country as a whole that, together with our social partners, we have agreed to a vigorous and wide-ranging skills development and acquisition programme to meet any shortfalls we may experience.  "
"5749",2006,"Mbeki","Among other things, we have already agreed to establish within a few weeks a multi-stakeholder working group, JIPSA, the Joint Initiative on Priority Skills Acquisition, through which government, business, labour and civil society will act jointly to respond to the skills challenge in as practical a manner as possible.  "
"5750",2006,"Mbeki","I would like to extend the sincere thanks of our Deputy President and government as a whole to the response of the Freedom Front + and other formations and individuals, who have responded to our appeal for South Africans with the necessary skills to make themselves available to provide the required expertise in project management and other areas.  "
"5751",2006,"Mbeki","The first group of the 90 already identified and assessed, will be deployed in their new posts in May.  "
"5752",2006,"Mbeki","We will, of course, also make other interventions in the area of education and training. "
"5753",2006,"Mbeki","These include eliminating fees for the poorest quintile of primary schools, targeting 529 schools to double the Maths and Science graduate output to 50 000 by 2008, and re-equipping and financing the Further Education and Training Colleges.  "
"5754",2006,"Mbeki","Last year, we completed the task of registering unemployed graduates, with over 60 000 in the database. "
"5755",2006,"Mbeki","We wish to express our appreciation to the many companies that last December pledged to employ some of these graduates. "
"5756",2006,"Mbeki","An intensive campaign to link up these graduates with these and other companies will be undertaken this year.  "
"5757",2006,"Mbeki","During this year, when we celebrate the 90th anniversary of the establishment of the University of Fort Hare, we will continue to engage the leadership of our tertiary institutions focused on working with them to meet the nation’s expectations with regard to teaching and research. "
"5758",2006,"Mbeki","For its part, the government is determined to increase the resource allocation for Research and Development and Innovation, and increase the pool of young researchers.  "
"5759",2006,"Mbeki","ASGISA identified other constraints to growth and development, apart from the issue of skills, the cost of doing business and the unnecessarily high cost of intermediate inputs. "
"5760",2006,"Mbeki","Work is proceeding to address all these constraints, including the limited domestic market and monetary and financial issues.  "
"5761",2006,"Mbeki","ASGISA has once more confirmed the need for us to expand our small, medium and micro enterprise (SMME) sector, paying particular attention in this regard to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment, and the development of women and the youth.  "
"5762",2006,"Mbeki","We will therefore take the necessary measures to ensure the effectiveness of such existing programmes as the Apex (Micro-credit) Fund, Mafisa (for agricultural development), SEDA (the Small Enterprise Development Agency), Khula, the Msobomvu Youth Fund, the IDC Small Business Initiative, and so on. "
"5763",2006,"Mbeki","We will also intensify our engagement of the Financial Services Charter signatories to help generate the necessary resources for the development of the SMME sector.  "
"5764",2006,"Mbeki","Our experience with regard to the development of this sector indicates that we must pay particular attention to issues of access to capital, entrepreneurial training, assistance with marketing, and the development of cooperatives. "
"5765",2006,"Mbeki","Further, to contribute to the growth of the SMME sector, the government will reform its procurement programme to access some of its goods and services from small and medium businesses, ensuring that it pays for what it purchases promptly.  "
"5766",2006,"Mbeki","We will also speed up the consultative process to determine the measures we must take to improve the regulatory climate to facilitate the expansion of this sector. "
"5767",2006,"Mbeki","This intervention will form part of the overall programme to introduce a regulatory impact assessment system to enable the government regularly to assess the impact of its policies on economic activity in our country.  "
"5768",2006,"Mbeki","The years of freedom have been very good for business. "
"5769",2006,"Mbeki","I believe that this should have convinced the investor community by now that, in its own interest and as part of the national effort, it has to invest in the expansion of that freedom, especially by actively and consciously contributing towards the achievement of the goal of halving poverty and unemployment by 2014.  "
"5770",2006,"Mbeki","ASGISA, which builds on the results of the Growth and Development Summit, offers this investor community an excellent opportunity to respond to this challenge in a deliberate and consistent manner, in its own interest.  "
"5771",2006,"Mbeki","Similarly, and also as part of the national effort, the trade union movement and civil society as a whole face the challenge to translate into action the commitment they made with the other social partners at the Growth and Development Summit “to a common vision for promoting rising levels of growth, investment, job creation, and people-centred development.”  "
"5772",2006,"Mbeki","ASGISA provides a golden opportunity for the social partners to undertake the “collaborative action” they visualised at the GDS focused on “Promoting and mobilising investment and creating decent work for all.”  "
"5773",2006,"Mbeki","The impressive growth rates achieved by our economy in the current period have been driven in good measure by high consumer demand, significantly financed through credit. "
"5774",2006,"Mbeki","This has increased our imports more than our exports. "
"5775",2006,"Mbeki","Despite high commodity prices, the resultant balance of payments deficit has been financed by inflows of foreign capital.  "
"5776",2006,"Mbeki","Through ASGISA we will increase the significance of the supply-side drivers of our growth. "
"5777",2006,"Mbeki","A corollary of this is, of course, that we must ensure the international competitiveness of the goods and services we produce.  "
"5778",2006,"Mbeki","This speaks directly to the common objective agreed by the social partners at the Growth and Development Summit, to “promote rising levels of growth, investment, job creation, and people-centred development.”  "
"5779",2006,"Mbeki","I have already mentioned the fact that to meet our developmental objectives, which must respond to the high expectations of our people, we will pay special attention to the critical task of strengthening local government.  "
"5780",2006,"Mbeki","Our government considers this to be especially important at this stage of our evolution. "
"5781",2006,"Mbeki","After the March 1st local government elections, all three spheres of government will therefore continue working together to ensure that each and every District and Metro municipality is properly positioned to discharge its responsibility to the people.  "
"5782",2006,"Mbeki","In particular, this will mean that each of these municipalities has a realistic Integrated Development Plan, a credible Local Economic Development Programme, and the material and human resources, as well as the management and operational systems to implement these IDPs and LEDs.  "
"5783",2006,"Mbeki","Integration of planning and implementation across the government spheres is therefore one of the prime areas of focus in our programme for the next term of local government. "
"5784",2006,"Mbeki","In this regard we will be guided by the Inter-Governmental Relations Framework Act.  "
"5785",2006,"Mbeki","We must in practice respect the system of cooperative governance, and within this context ensure that we empower local government to discharge its development and service delivery obligations, drawing on the lessons provided by Project Consolidate.  "
"5786",2006,"Mbeki","As many of us are aware by now, Project Consolidate has identified serious capacity constraints in many of our municipalities arising from a shortage of properly qualified managers, professional and technical personnel. "
"5787",2006,"Mbeki","We have taken the necessary decisions to attend to this urgent matter.  "
"5788",2006,"Mbeki","To improve the ability, particularly of local government to meet the needs of the people, by March this year we shall have deployed 3 000 Community Development Workers.  "
"5789",2006,"Mbeki","Even as we implement the programmes focused on accelerated and shared growth, with its important element of job creation, we cannot forget that the social wage plays a vital role in our continuing efforts to address the challenge of poverty.  "
"5790",2006,"Mbeki","For instance 7 million children now receive the child support grant. "
"5791",2006,"Mbeki","A total of 10 million of our citizens receive social grants. "
"5792",2006,"Mbeki","Real social expenditure per person increased by 60% between 1983 and 2003. "
"5793",2006,"Mbeki","Detailed evidence from a study conducted by Haroon Bhorat, Prakash Naidoo and Carlene van der Westhuizen indicates that there has been a consistent shift in expenditure in favour of poorer households.  "
"5794",2006,"Mbeki","To improve delivery in this area, we will continue to implement our comprehensive anti-fraud strategy. "
"5795",2006,"Mbeki","Already many of those who have been stealing social grants have been brought to book. "
"5796",2006,"Mbeki","This work will improve with the launch of the National Social Security Agency.  "
"5797",2006,"Mbeki","In the area of health, over 1 300 clinics have benefited from the upgrading programme and more have received additional equipment; and the programme to revitalise hospitals is proceeding apace. "
"5798",2006,"Mbeki","The extension of Community Service to a range of health professionals has ensured that at any one time over 2 000 such professionals are available in public health institutions. "
"5799",2006,"Mbeki","Our future plans in this area include the further expansion of the health infrastructure, the refurbishment of existing clinics and hospitals, and the re-opening of Nursing Colleges to increase the numbers of these important professionals.  "
"5800",2006,"Mbeki","To improve service delivery in our hospitals, by September this year we will ensure that hospital managers are delegated authority and held accountable for the functioning of hospitals, with policy issues regarding training, job grading and accountability managed by provincial Health Departments which themselves will need restructuring properly to play their role.  "
"5801",2006,"Mbeki","The Operational Plan for Comprehensive Prevention, Treatment and Care of HIV and AIDS has resulted in the upgrading of hundreds of facilities. "
"5802",2006,"Mbeki","To date, over 100 000 patients are receiving Antiretroviral Treatment and, combined with patients in the private sector, South Africa has one of the largest such treatment programme in the world.  "
"5803",2006,"Mbeki","During the course of this year, in addition to accelerating the expansion of our housing stock to address the needs of the homeless, we will take concrete steps to ensure that housing development contributes to eliminating the duality of living spaces inherited from apartheid.  "
"5804",2006,"Mbeki","Already, the Ministry of Housing and the South African Local Government Association have reached an agreement on the sale of land for housing development. "
"5805",2006,"Mbeki","Through this agreement, municipalities will allocate land close to economic centres for housing development for middle and lower income people.   "
"5806",2006,"Mbeki","In addition, as part of our effort to help the poor to access housing finance, the National Housing Finance Corporation (NHFC) will be transformed into a Housing Corporation that will provide finance to the poor and middle-income groups.  "
"5807",2006,"Mbeki","In this context, we expect our Minister of Housing and the leadership of the Financial Institutions to reach final agreement without further delay on the modalities for utilising the R42 billion set aside by the financial institutions for housing development for poor and middle-income groups thus contributing to the National Effort.  "
"5808",2006,"Mbeki","This is central to the attainment of a society free of shack settlements in which all our people enjoy decent housing. "
"5809",2006,"Mbeki","In this context, I should also mention that government has decided that we must completely eradicate, in the established settlements, the “bucket toilets” by the end of 2007.  "
"5810",2006,"Mbeki","Land reform and land restitution are critical to the transformation of our society. "
"5811",2006,"Mbeki","Accordingly, the state will play a more central role in the land reform programme ensuring that the restitution programme is accelerated, further contributing to the empowerment of the poor, especially in the rural areas.  "
"5812",2006,"Mbeki","The Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs will, during 2006:  * review the willing-buyer willing-seller policy; * review land acquisition models and possible manipulation of land prices; and * regulate conditions under which foreigners buy land. "
"5813",2006,"Mbeki","This will be done in line with international norms and practices.  "
"5814",2006,"Mbeki","The Minister and the Department will also ensure that the land redistribution programme is aligned to the Provincial Growth and Development Strategies (PGDS) as well as the Integrated Development Plans (IDP) of municipalities, as well as attend to the proper use of the funds that have been made available for the productive utilisation of the land.  "
"5815",2006,"Mbeki","When we talk about the land question, we must not forget that this year we will commemorate the Centenary of the Bambata Uprising in the present day KwaZulu-Natal, which was occasioned by the imposition of a poll tax to drive the people off the land, forcing them to join the ranks of the proletariat. "
"5816",2006,"Mbeki","In praise of Bambata it was said:  Ingqungqulu eshaya amaphiko Kwadilika izixhobo eHlenyane. "
"5817",2006,"Mbeki","Izulu eliphose umbane phansi eHlenyane, Kwacandeka imisululu. "
"5818",2006,"Mbeki","Kwadilika izindonga.  "
"5819",2006,"Mbeki","Usibamba nkunzana Ekade beyesaba Ngoba ebambe abamhlophe Umhlane ubelethe amagwala!  "
"5820",2006,"Mbeki","In this year of the 30th anniversary of the Soweto Uprising, we shall ensure that the focus on youth development is intensified in all spheres of government. "
"5821",2006,"Mbeki","Among other things during the next financial year we will set up 100 new Youth Advisory Centres, enrol at least 10 000 young people in the National Youth Service Programme and enrol 5 000 volunteers to act as mentors to vulnerable children.  "
"5822",2006,"Mbeki","We will also expand the reach of our business support system to young people and intensify the Youth Co-operatives Programme. "
"5823",2006,"Mbeki","We will closely monitor the impact of our programmes on youth skills training and business empowerment as an integral part of our National Effort.  "
"5824",2006,"Mbeki","The ASGISA process has also helped us greatly by exposing us to the concerns of women with regard to their economic prospects. "
"5825",2006,"Mbeki","Among others, the women have pointed to the need for us to focus on issues of access to finance, development of co-operatives, fast-tracking women artisans and providing “set-asides” for women in government and public enterprises procurement programmes.  "
"5826",2006,"Mbeki","I believe that the very fact that this year we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Women’s March underlines the need for us to ensure that these issues receive the necessary attention in the implementation of our development programmes.  "
"5827",2006,"Mbeki","The government will continue to focus on the critical challenge of further improving our criminal justice system. "
"5828",2006,"Mbeki","Among other things, we will focus on integrated law enforcement operations in priority areas, reducing the number of illegal firearms and ensuring better processing of applications for firearm licences, reducing drug trafficking and substance abuse, and implementing social crime prevention measures.  "
"5829",2006,"Mbeki","We will further improve case-load management in our courts, building four additional correctional facilities, reduce the number of children in custody, and implement the recommendations of the Jali Commission.  "
"5830",2006,"Mbeki","Other important matters include the post-TRC management of cases pertaining to conflicts of the past, processing of legislation on matters pertaining to the rationalisation of our courts, consideration of the recommendations of the Khampepe Commission on the Directorate of Special Operations, and strengthening our intelligence structures to support law enforcement agencies and ensure the security of the state and its citizens.  "
"5831",2006,"Mbeki","Perhaps, needless to say, the government will remain focused on the challenge to fight corruption in the public sector and in society at large. "
"5832",2006,"Mbeki","We will continue to intensify our offensive on this front, fully aware of the fact that much that happens in our society encourages the entrenchment of a value system based on personal acquisition of wealth by all means and at all cost.  "
"5833",2006,"Mbeki","Five months from now, the FIFA Soccer World Cup tournament, hosted by Germany, will come to its triumphant end with the passage of the host’s baton to our country. "
"5834",2006,"Mbeki","From then on, until 2010, the whole world will watch us carefully to judge whether we will be a worthy host of this prestigious tournament.  "
"5835",2006,"Mbeki","I am afraid that our performance in the current African Cup of Nations in Egypt did nothing to advertise our strengths as a winning nation. "
"5836",2006,"Mbeki","However, starting today, the nation must bend every effort to ensure that we meet all the expectations of FIFA and the world of soccer, so that we host the best Soccer World Cup ever.  "
"5837",2006,"Mbeki","Simultaneously as we work together to restore the sport of soccer in our country to full health, and prepare a winning national team, we must ensure that we work full steam ahead to get everything else ready for a successful Soccer World Cup.  "
"5838",2006,"Mbeki","This will encompass the stadia, broadcast facilities, including high-definition television, the necessary transport and hospitality infrastructure, safety and security, popular support for soccer and the World Cup, and selfless dedication by the local organisers of the tournament.  "
"5839",2006,"Mbeki","The 2010 Soccer World Cup will make an important contribution to our effort to accelerate our progress towards the achievement of the goal of a better life for our people. "
"5840",2006,"Mbeki","Similarly, as an African Soccer World Cup, it will give additional impetus to our struggle to achieve Africa’s renaissance.  "
"5841",2006,"Mbeki","In return for these irreplaceable benefits, we owe it to FIFA and the rest of the soccer world to prepare properly for 2010. "
"5842",2006,"Mbeki","I trust that the domestic world of soccer will respond to this challenge with all necessary seriousness, commitment and patriotism.  "
"5843",2006,"Mbeki","During 2006 we will continue to engage the African challenges, focusing on peace and democracy in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire and Sudan, the strengthening of the African Union and the acceleration of the process of the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) programmes. "
"5844",2006,"Mbeki","In this context we have to ensure that we conduct a successful self-assessment process as we prepare our national report for the African Peer Review Mechanism.  "
"5845",2006,"Mbeki","As the current Chair of the G77 + China we will do everything possible to advance the interests of the South, including in the context of the continuing WTO negotiations, and the urgent challenge to reform the United Nations, including the Security Council.  "
"5846",2006,"Mbeki","We remain actively engaged to help find solutions to the various matters relating to the Israel/Palestine and the Iranian issues. "
"5847",2006,"Mbeki","We are committed to the pursuit of negotiated agreements in this regard, consistent with our long held views in favour of the formation of a State of Palestine, security for Israel, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  "
"5848",2006,"Mbeki","Two anniversaries that we will commemorate this year will serve to emphasise the bonds that tie us to the rest of the world. "
"5849",2006,"Mbeki","These are the Centenary of Satyagraha, the non-violent struggle started by Mahatma Gandhi in our country in 1906 and continued in India, and the 20th anniversary of the violent death of President Samora Machel in our country in 1986, in a plane crash that still requires a satisfactory explanation.  "
"5850",2006,"Mbeki","Next week we will host a meeting of the Progressive Governance group, which will bring to our country important leaders from all corners of the globe. "
"5851",2006,"Mbeki","Their presence in our country will communicate the message that we cannot and will not walk away from our internationalist responsibility to add our voice to global effort to create a better world of peace, democracy, a just world order and prosperity for all nations.  "
"5852",2006,"Mbeki","Clearly the masses of our people are convinced that our country has entered into its Age of Hope. "
"5853",2006,"Mbeki","They believe that the country they love, their only homeland, will not disappoint their expectation of an accelerated advance towards the day when they will be liberated from the suffocating tentacles of the legacy of colonialism and apartheid.  "
"5854",2006,"Mbeki","They are confident that what our country has done to move us away from our apartheid past has created the conditions for them to appropriate God’s blessing to the Prophet Isaiah:  For you shall go out with joy, And be led out in peace; The mountains and the hills Shall break forth into singing before you, And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.  "
"5855",2006,"Mbeki","It is up to all of us, through our National Effort, to build a winning nation, to do all the things that will ensure that the mountains and the hills of our country break forth into singing before all our people, and all the trees of the field clap their hands to applaud the people’s season of joy.  "
"5856",2006,"Mbeki","Thank you."
"5857",2005,"Mbeki"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly; Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Deputy President of the Republic; Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament; Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary; Heads of our Security Services; Governor of the Reserve Bank; President Mandela and Mrs Graca Machel; President Jean Bertrand Aristide and Madame Aristide; President of the Pan African Parliament, the Hon Gertrude Mongella; Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Premiers and leaders of SALGA, Mayor of Cape Town and other leaders in our system of local government; Our honoured traditional leaders; Heads of the state organs supporting our democratic system; Directors-General, Heads of our State Corporations and other leaders of the public service; Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners; Distinguished guests, friends and comrades; People of South Africa:  As we open this Second Session of our Third Democratic Parliament, which will straddle the end of the First and the beginning of the Second Decade of Democracy, I am privileged to say that as a people we have every reason to be proud of our historic achievements during our First Decade of Democracy.  "
"5858",2005,"Mbeki","Central to these achievements is our success in advancing our country away from its divided past, towards the realisation of the vision contained in the Freedom Charter - whose 50th anniversary we celebrate this year - that, ""South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white.""  "
"5859",2005,"Mbeki","Of significant interest in this regard is the fact that this year we also commemorate the 50th anniversary of one of the most infamous forced removals in our country - the destruction of Sophiatown in Johannesburg, and its transformation into a white group area renamed Triomf, the Triumph of white supremacy.  "
"5860",2005,"Mbeki","This horrible act of violence against a people made the unequivocal and practical statement that the government of the day was determined to communicate the understanding that South Africa did not belong to all who live in it.  "
"5861",2005,"Mbeki","But as the Honourable Members know, our constitution-makers incorporated in the 1996 Constitution the alternative vision adopted at the Congress of the People during the same year of the destruction of Sophiatown, as reflected in the Freedom Charter. "
"5862",2005,"Mbeki","Our Constitution therefore states that ""We, the people of South Africa, believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.""  "
"5863",2005,"Mbeki","As a consequence of the victories we have registered during our first ten years of freedom, we have laid a firm foundation for the new advances we must and will make during the next decade.  "
"5864",2005,"Mbeki","This foundation must help us to move even further forward towards the consolidation of national reconciliation, national cohesion and unity, and a shared new patriotism born of the strengthening of the manifest reality of a South Africa that belongs to all who live in it, united in their diversity.  "
"5865",2005,"Mbeki","It must help us to take the detailed practical steps to achieve better results today and tomorrow than we did yesterday.  "
"5866",2005,"Mbeki","This means that during each one of the years that make up our Second Decade of Liberation, including this one, we must achieve new and decisive advances towards:  the further entrenchment of democracy in our country; transforming our country into a genuinely non-racial society; transforming our country into a genuinely non-sexist society; eradicating poverty and underdevelopment, within the context of a thriving and growing First Economy and the successful transformation of the Second Economy; opening the vistas towards the spiritual and material fulfilment of each and every South African; securing the safety and security of all our people; building a strong and efficient democratic state that truly serves the interests of the people; and, contributing to the victory of the African Renaissance and the achievement of the goal of a better life for the peoples of Africa and the rest of the world. "
"5867",2005,"Mbeki","These objectives constitute the central architecture of our policies and programmes, intended to ensure that South Africa truly belongs to all who live in it, black and white.  "
"5868",2005,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, we are privileged to have among us, as on previous occasions, our distinguished Chief Justice, Judge Arthur Chaskalson. "
"5869",2005,"Mbeki","I regret to say that this is the last time he will be with us in these Houses of Parliament as our Chief Justice.  "
"5870",2005,"Mbeki","Early last year, the Chief Justice reminded me that 14 February 2005, three days from today, will mark the 10th Anniversary of the inauguration of our Constitutional Court. "
"5871",2005,"Mbeki","He felt then that ten years was a long time for one person to hold office as the head of our apex court, as he has done.  "
"5872",2005,"Mbeki","He therefore thought it right and proper that he should take advantage of the beginning of the Second Decade of the Constitutional Court to retire from the Bench. "
"5873",2005,"Mbeki","We agreed that we should meet again at the beginning of this year to consider this matter, which we have now done.  "
"5874",2005,"Mbeki","Chief Justice Chaskalson has convinced me that his own determination to continue to contribute to the birth of our nation, rather than personal considerations, dictates that he should relinquish his high post. "
"5875",2005,"Mbeki","I have listened carefully to his moving argument and was similarly moved to agree to his request.  "
"5876",2005,"Mbeki","We have therefore agreed that he will be discharged from active service in our judiciary on the 31st of May, this year. "
"5877",2005,"Mbeki","Consequently I will take the necessary steps to consult the Judicial Service Commission and the leaders of the political parties represented in our National Parliament to determine who will be our next Chief Justice from the 1st of June, this year.  "
"5878",2005,"Mbeki","I am privileged to have the opportunity on this important occasion on our national calendar to convey our thanks to, and salute a great son of our people, Chief Justice Arthur Chaskalson. "
"5879",2005,"Mbeki","I trust that later this year, Parliament will give all of us an opportunity to bid this giant among the architects of our democracy the fitting farewell that the constraints of time today prohibit.  "
"5880",2005,"Mbeki","On behalf of the nation, I am honoured to convey our humble thanks to you, Chief Justice Arthur Chaskalson, for everything you have done as a South African, a lawyer and a judge, to shepherd us towards the construction of a South Africa that truly belongs to all who live in it.  "
"5881",2005,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker:  Also among us, both as Honourable Members and guests, are the volunteers who trudged the expanse of our country more than five decades ago, to gather the views of South Africans with regard to the kind of alternative society they wished to see, which culminated in the Congress of the People held 50 years ago that adopted the Freedom Charter.  "
"5882",2005,"Mbeki","It is a tribute to their foresight, courage and humanism that the product of their labours, the Freedom Charter, finds its reflection in the basic law of our land, our Constitution.  "
"5883",2005,"Mbeki","One of those volunteers is with us today. "
"5884",2005,"Mbeki","We are happy today to express the gratitude of the nation to Madoda Nsibande, and others.  "
"5885",2005,"Mbeki","Also among us is John Nkadimeng, a volunteer himself and founder-leader of the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU), which was formed 50 years ago. "
"5886",2005,"Mbeki","We also have with us Chris Dlamini, representing the corps of worker-leaders who brought together various unions to establish Cosatu 20 years ago, the bearer of the baton of progressive trade unionism in our country.  "
"5887",2005,"Mbeki","Through their efforts, which we acknowledge in this Chamber today, John Nkadimeng, Chris Dlamini and their colleagues ensured that we can today say with pride that South Africa belongs also to all the working people of our country.  "
"5888",2005,"Mbeki","Allow me, Madame Speaker, also to acknowledge the late Gavin Relly, Zac de Beer and Tony Bloom who led the delegation that braved the threats and scorn of the then apartheid regime, to meet Oliver Tambo and other leaders of the liberation movement in Lusaka in 1985.  "
"5889",2005,"Mbeki","I would also like to pay tribute to the late Kobie Coetsee who, 20 years ago, initiated the first contact between the apartheid regime and Nelson Mandela, which led among other things to the release of Nelson Mandela 15 years ago today.  "
"5890",2005,"Mbeki","We further acknowledge the family of the artist, Thami Mnyele, one of those who 20 years ago was killed in his sleep by soldiers of the SADF who carried out an act of aggression in Gaborone, Botswana, targeting those of our people it had driven into exile.  "
"5891",2005,"Mbeki","Also among us in this chamber today is Helena Dolny representing the family of Joe Slovo, who passed away 10 years ago. "
"5892",2005,"Mbeki","As all of us know, in addition to everything else he did as an architect of our democracy, Joe Slovo started the programme that would make the homeless feel that South Africa belongs to them as well.  "
"5893",2005,"Mbeki","We are honoured that these esteemed South Africans have taken time to be with us today, to give us the privilege to salute them and their loved ones.  "
"5894",2005,"Mbeki","Like Angel Jones and Marina Smithers of the Homecoming Revolution, we know very well that, today, our country and continent provide the best and most promising locations for the solution of many of the problems that trouble the whole of humanity. "
"5895",2005,"Mbeki","All of us face the task to respond to this historic challenge.  "
"5896",2005,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker;  In May last year, in the aftermath of our third democratic elections, we set out the Programme of Action of government to achieve higher rates of economic growth and development, improve the quality of life of all our people, and consolidate our social cohesion.  "
"5897",2005,"Mbeki","We did this confident that the progress we had made in the First Decade of Freedom provided the platform for us to move forward faster, with better quality of outputs and better outcomes in building a society that cares.  "
"5898",2005,"Mbeki","With regard to the economy, a recent report of the Rand Merchant Bank prepared by the economist Rudolf Gouws says:  ""Real domestic output growth accelerated through last year to reach an annualised 5,6 per cent in the third quarter - a rate last seen in 1996 - with contributions coming from all sectors of the economy. "
"5899",2005,"Mbeki","In terms of economic growth, South Africa has long been underperforming its emerging-market peer group, but the newfound higher growth path is bringing the country more in line with other successful emerging-market nations.  "
"5900",2005,"Mbeki","""..."
"5901",2005,"Mbeki","The current economic upswing, which began in September 1999, is not only the longest upward phase of the business cycle in the post-WWII period, but should also be sustainable into the future. "
"5902",2005,"Mbeki","One of the reasons is that the economy is in the process of changing from one driven predominantly by consumption (government as well as households), to one driven to a greater degree by fixed investment.  "
"5903",2005,"Mbeki","""As a consequence of the stronger growth, the employment picture in South Africa has gradually begun to improve. "
"5904",2005,"Mbeki","While South Africa certainly still has a major unemployment problem, there are encouraging signs.""  "
"5905",2005,"Mbeki","Gouws comments on what he calls 'government's good track-record of implementing prudent fiscal policies' and continues:  ""But the improvements in overall government finances were not brought about primarily to please the financial markets and the rating agencies, but rather to ensure that government is able to deliver services to the population in a sustainable way. "
"5906",2005,"Mbeki","Concurrent with the turnaround in public finances were important institutional changes and improvements in the ability of government to deliver.""  "
"5907",2005,"Mbeki","He concludes by saying that:  ""Faster growth, coupled with efforts to improve the environment for doing business and addressing the plight of the poor more effectively, means improved chances for a sustainable improvement in the general welfare of all South Africans.""  "
"5908",2005,"Mbeki","We agree with the observations made by Rudolf Gouws. "
"5909",2005,"Mbeki","Indeed, because of the factors he mentioned, we have, for instance, with 90% coverage of most social grants, almost met the objective we set for ourselves in 2002, of ensuring that all who are eligible for these grants receive them within three years.  "
"5910",2005,"Mbeki","Last December we passed the 10-million mark in terms of South Africans who have gained access to potable water since 1994. "
"5911",2005,"Mbeki","Free basic water of 6 kilolitres per household per month is now being provided to about three-quarters of households in the areas of our country that have the infrastructure to supply potable water.  "
"5912",2005,"Mbeki","Since 1994 close to 2 million housing subsidies have been allocated to the poor. "
"5913",2005,"Mbeki","Education remains our largest single budgetary item, with primary school enrolment rates remaining steady at about 95,5% since 1995 and secondary school enrolments currently at 85%.  "
"5914",2005,"Mbeki","The gross annual value of the social wage was about R88 billion in 2003 with the poor being the largest beneficiaries. "
"5915",2005,"Mbeki","The democratic state will not walk away from its obligation to come to the aid of the poor, bearing in mind available resources.  "
"5916",2005,"Mbeki","In this context, we must also refer to the latest Report of the UNISA Bureau of Market Research on ""National Personal Income of South Africans by Population Group, Income Group, Life Stage and Lifeplane 1960-2007"".  "
"5917",2005,"Mbeki","Among other things, this Report says: ""In 2001, 4,1 million out of 11,2 million households in South Africa lived on an income of R9 600 and less per year. "
"5918",2005,"Mbeki","This decreased to 3, 6 million households in 2004, even after taking the negative effect of price increases on spending power into account. "
"5919",2005,"Mbeki","On the other hand, the number of households receiving a real income of R153 601 and more per annum rose from 721 000 in 1998 to more than 1,2 million in 2004.""  "
"5920",2005,"Mbeki","The additional social expenditures we have mentioned demonstrate what Rudolf Gouws was referring to when he said that the ""the improvements in overall government finances were (brought about) to ensure that government is able to deliver services to the population in a sustainable way"".  "
"5921",2005,"Mbeki","On the other hand, reflecting on one element of the programme that we announced last May - the issue of school infrastructure - the editor of ""City Press"" said correctly that:  "" [T]he backlog of classrooms still runs into several thousand nationwide ... "
"5922",2005,"Mbeki","[W]e believe that addressing the crisis in education is perhaps the most urgent priority. "
"5923",2005,"Mbeki","The March deadline will not be met... "
"5924",2005,"Mbeki","[Government] must work out a plan that will ensure the speedy delivery of classrooms to all.""  "
"5925",2005,"Mbeki","Overall, our own detailed assessment of the implementation of our programme of action reveals that of the 307 concrete actions contained in the government's programme, some of which we announced in the last State of the Nation Address:  51% of those with specific time frames have been undertaken or are being undertaken within the deadlines we set; 21% have been or are being undertaken, though there were slight delays in terms of the time frames that we had set ourselves; 28% have not been fully carried out, and the reasons behind the delays are such that new deadlines will have to be set for their accomplishment. "
"5926",2005,"Mbeki","In other words, 72% of these programmes are being carried out within the broad framework of the time frames we had set ourselves. 86% of the concrete actions that did not have specific time frames are progressing as envisaged, while 14% show some delays that call for urgent attention by government.  "
"5927",2005,"Mbeki","I wish to thank our colleagues in Cabinet, the Provincial Executives and municipal executive councils, the public service as well as the leadership of our social partners who have put shoulders to the wheel to ensure that we carry out that which is expected of us jointly and severally to meet our common national objectives.  "
"5928",2005,"Mbeki","We also highly appreciate the oversight role as well as the direct contribution in the crucible of actual implementation of our public representatives in all the three spheres of government. "
"5929",2005,"Mbeki","We are confident that Honourable Members will persist in this service to the people, so as to improve our work, all-round.  "
"5930",2005,"Mbeki","What then is the programme of government for the year, and how shall we build on the work done in the past decade in general and the past nine months in particular?  "
"5931",2005,"Mbeki","As Honourable Members will know, the details of the actions in each of last year's programmatic areas have been published on the government website. "
"5932",2005,"Mbeki","I shall therefore only identify the major issues in terms of our past work, and then outline some of the things that need to be done in the coming year.  "
"5933",2005,"Mbeki","With regard to interventions to grow the First Economy, the broad objectives we set ourselves remain the same. "
"5934",2005,"Mbeki","We will continue our consultations with our social partners to ensure that our economy continues to steam ahead, as Rudolf Gouws predicted.  "
"5935",2005,"Mbeki","Our programme for the coming year is premised on the broad objectives to increase investment in the economy, lower the cost of doing business, improve economic inclusion and provide the skills required by the economy. "
"5936",2005,"Mbeki","Therefore, the details outlined in May last year, to the extent that the tasks are ongoing, remain an integral part of the programme.  "
"5937",2005,"Mbeki","On infrastructure, we have since May 2004, developed strategies and investment plans upward of R180-billion in relation to transport logistics, electricity and water resources. "
"5938",2005,"Mbeki","We would like to cite only two instances in this regard.  "
"5939",2005,"Mbeki","Transnet has already approved business plans for new investments in the Durban and Cape Town harbours, as well as the construction of a new pipeline between Durban and Johannesburg. "
"5940",2005,"Mbeki","As it brings three previously decommissioned power stations into operation, Eskom will add R5,86 billion to the GDP by 2007, with new jobs created peaking during the same year at 36 000. "
"5941",2005,"Mbeki","We have also taken steps the better to manage administered prices, through the actions of independent regulators as well as through more rigorous monitoring which will see an Administered Prices Index produced by the official statisticians from the first quarter of this year.  "
"5942",2005,"Mbeki","Discussions continue with the steel and chemical industries in particular to reach agreement on the issue of Import Parity Pricing. "
"5943",2005,"Mbeki","Government has decided to avoid using legislation or regulations even in the face of these obvious market failures.  "
"5944",2005,"Mbeki","We believe that there is growing consensus among economic role-players with regard to what we are seeking to do. "
"5945",2005,"Mbeki","This is to ensure that, working with especially the producers of inputs that are strategic for economic growth, we find a resolution to this matter in a manner that addresses the interests of both these producers and the downstream industries.  "
"5946",2005,"Mbeki","Bold steps have been taken further to liberalise the telecommunications industry. "
"5947",2005,"Mbeki","We believe that the unacceptable situation in which some of our fixed line rates are 10 times those of developed (OECD) countries will soon become a thing of the past. "
"5948",2005,"Mbeki","We also hope that the delays in setting up the Second National Operator, arising from legal processes which are beyond government's control, will be resolved in due course, and as soon as possible.  "
"5949",2005,"Mbeki","Further work has been done to improve the work of defining and implementing sectoral charters, as agreed at the Growth and Development Summit in 2003.  "
"5950",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, I especially and warmly welcome the decision of the South African banks to implement the provisions of the Financial Sector Charter, as a result of which they have made a public three-year commitment to provide at least R85 billion to finance low-cost housing, infrastructure, black small business enterprises and new black farmers.  "
"5951",2005,"Mbeki","Elements of the Codes of Good Practice for Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment have been released for public comment, and once this process is finalised, it will then be possible to appoint the Black Economic Empowerment Council. "
"5952",2005,"Mbeki","Related to these efforts is the progress made in setting up the Small Enterprise Development Agency, to improve our government's performance in the critical area of the development of small and medium enterprises.  "
"5953",2005,"Mbeki","With the commitments from the private sector as demonstrated by the banks, it is clear that together, as South Africans, we are set to make a determined effort to speed up broad-based black economic empowerment and small business development.  "
"5954",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, I would like to mention and welcome the announcement made by the CEO of Anglo American South Africa, Lazarus Zim in the last few days, indicating the large resources his company will spend to empower a great number of black enterprises.  "
"5955",2005,"Mbeki","To ensure properly focused development planning, Cabinet is working to align the National Spatial Development Perspective with the Provincial Growth and Development Strategies and the municipal Integrated Development Plans.  "
"5956",2005,"Mbeki","To increase the numbers of skilled workers, we have met the target set by the Growth and Development Summit and trained more than 80 000 learners. "
"5957",2005,"Mbeki","We have also released the draft immigration regulations for public comment.  "
"5958",2005,"Mbeki","It is however clear that more work will have to be done to raise the skills levels of our people. "
"5959",2005,"Mbeki","Accordingly, the government has approved a new National Skills Development Strategy for the period 2005-2010. "
"5960",2005,"Mbeki","R21,9 billion over five years will be allocated to fund this Strategy, which will include improved cooperation between the SETAs on one hand, and the Further Training and Education colleges and the institutions of higher education on the other.  "
"5961",2005,"Mbeki","At the same time, we have taken note of the reasons for the delay in implementing some of the announced programmes. "
"5962",2005,"Mbeki","These include the complexities of the tasks to be carried out, the rigour required in planning and implementing these actions across all the spheres, the magnitude of resources demanded, and the subjective capacity of the implementing agents where at least financial resources were made available.  "
"5963",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, government will ensure that the outstanding tasks are attended to within the next three months. "
"5964",2005,"Mbeki","These are:  finalising the government-wide review of performance practices in State-Owned Enterprises; finalising discussions, especially in the context of the Financial Sector Charter, on investing 5% of investible capital of financial institutions in productive activity; completing the strategy on better utilisation of the Isibaya Fund of the Public Investment Commission; investing R220-million from the Rail Commuter Corporation for commuter transport and safety; improving the effectiveness of the skills development structures in government for the implementation of the Human Resources Development Strategy; completing the register of all graduates; and using the review of Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) to bring about the necessary changes in the supervision and governance of these Authorities. "
"5965",2005,"Mbeki","In consultation with our social partners, a number of constraints limiting our capacity to embark on a higher growth path, will receive our urgent attention.  "
"5966",2005,"Mbeki","Based on the review of the regulatory framework as it applies to small, medium and micro-enterprises, before the end of the year, government will complete the system of exemptions for these businesses with regard to taxes, levies, as well as central bargaining and other labour arrangements, enabling these to be factored into the medium-term expenditure cycle.  "
"5967",2005,"Mbeki","The system of tax and levy payments and business registration will be reviewed, with the aim of introducing a simpler and streamlined system for all businesses by April 2006.  "
"5968",2005,"Mbeki","The capital investment programme of government will be speeded up focussing on housing, rural and urban infrastructure, public transport and national logistics system, water and electricity. "
"5969",2005,"Mbeki","In part to facilitate this, urgent steps will be taken to strengthen the Public-Private Partnership mechanism in government by December 2005. "
"5970",2005,"Mbeki","At all times these partnerships should involve local communities.  "
"5971",2005,"Mbeki","New steps are also being considered together with international investors to improve foreign capital inflows.  "
"5972",2005,"Mbeki","In order further to improve the capacity of government to service the needs of investors, specialist capacity in the Department of Trade and Industry will be beefed up.  "
"5973",2005,"Mbeki","Within the next nine months, we will make a special effort to finalise sector development strategies and programmes, with regard to:  chemicals, business outsourcing and tourism, which will receive additional immediate support; ICT and telecommunications, agro-processing, community and social services; and wood and paper, appliances, the retail and construction industries. "
"5974",2005,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker;  As we have asserted, success in the growth of our economy should be measured not merely in terms of the returns that accrue to investors or the job opportunities to those with skills. "
"5975",2005,"Mbeki","Rather, it should also manifest in the extent to which the marginalised in the wilderness of the Second Economy are included and are at least afforded sustainable livelihoods. "
"5976",2005,"Mbeki","South Africa belongs to them too, and none of us can in good conscience claim to be at ease before this becomes and is seen to become a reality.  "
"5977",2005,"Mbeki","During the past nine months, we started to put the Expanded Public Works Programme into operation. "
"5978",2005,"Mbeki","To date, we have spent over R1, 5 billion, created over 76 000 job opportunities and begun to afford thousands of those enrolled, with the skills that will stand them in good stead as they leave the programme.  "
"5979",2005,"Mbeki","A critical element in assisting those in the Second Economy is provision of information, particularly regarding how they can access economic opportunities. "
"5980",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, the targeted communication campaign on economic opportunities occupies a central place. "
"5981",2005,"Mbeki","We hope to partner the media, particularly the public broadcaster, to bring this information to many more people.  "
"5982",2005,"Mbeki","To assist in this regard, some 500 Community Development Workers have been enrolled as learners in Gauteng, Northern Cape, the Northwest and the Eastern Cape. "
"5983",2005,"Mbeki","Management structures have also been put in place to ensure the optimal utilisation of the Municipal Infrastructure Grant.  "
"5984",2005,"Mbeki","To take the interventions in the Second Economy forward, the following additional programmes will be introduced or further strengthened by April 2005, as part of the Expanded Public Works Programme and focussed on providing training, work experience and temporary income especially to women and youth. "
"5985",2005,"Mbeki","These are:  the Early Childhood Development programme, based on community participation, having ensured a common approach among all three spheres of government - the necessary additional funding will be provided; increasing the numbers of Community Health Workers, having harmonised training standards and increased resources allocated to the programme; and, the more extensive use of labour intensive methods of construction targeting housing, schools, clinics, sports facilities, community centres and the services infrastructure. "
"5986",2005,"Mbeki","Further, business plans for the Agricultural Credit Scheme have been approved. "
"5987",2005,"Mbeki","We will ensure that it becomes operational within the next three months, with the capital of R1-billion already allocated. "
"5988",2005,"Mbeki","This scheme forms part of the broader small and micro-credit initiative, to enable those formerly excluded the opportunity to access credit for productive purposes.  "
"5989",2005,"Mbeki","In addition, R100-million has been transferred to provinces for the implementation of the farmer support programme. "
"5990",2005,"Mbeki","The Apex Fund, the launch of which was delayed, will also become operational in this period. "
"5991",2005,"Mbeki","The Bill on co-operatives has been submitted to Parliament for finalisation.  "
"5992",2005,"Mbeki","Emphasis in all these Second Economy programmes will be put on those areas already identified for urban renewal and rural development.  "
"5993",2005,"Mbeki","Better to understand the dynamics in the Second Economy and ensure effective targeted interventions; a socio-economic survey of these communities will be conducted during the course of 2005. "
"5994",2005,"Mbeki","These surveys will then be carried out in three-year intervals.  "
"5995",2005,"Mbeki","Honourable Members;  With regard to the social sector, government has continued to allocate more resources and put in more effort to provide services to society at large and a safety net for the indigent. "
"5996",2005,"Mbeki","Project Consolidate of the Department of Provincial and Local Government will further increase the capacity of the municipalities to improve our performance in these areas.  "
"5997",2005,"Mbeki","In addition, campaigns to reduce non-communicable and communicable diseases as well as non-natural causes of death will continue, through the promotion of healthy life-styles and increased focus on TB, AIDS, Malaria, cholera and other water-borne diseases, and generally increasing the standard of living of the poorest among us.  "
"5998",2005,"Mbeki","Broad trends in mortality confirm the need for us to continue to pay particular attention to the health of our nation. "
"5999",2005,"Mbeki","With regard to AIDS in particular, the government's comprehensive plan, which is among the best in the world, combining awareness, treatment and home-based care is being implemented with greater vigour.  "
"6000",2005,"Mbeki","As Honourable Members would know, a new housing strategy has been adopted and increased resources will be allocated to meet the objectives that we have set ourselves.  "
"6001",2005,"Mbeki","We are also confident, given the evidence of progress thus far, that the various interventions in the area of education and training, including the merger of institutions of higher learning, improved teaching and learning especially in mathematics and natural sciences, and provision of additional support to schools in poor areas, will produce positive results, as planned. "
"6002",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, we are pleased to indicate that, in addition to allocations already announced for the salaries of educators, more resources will be allocated for this purpose in the new financial year.  "
"6003",2005,"Mbeki","Our social sector programme for the coming year will include the intensification of the programmes we identified last year, to meet our long-term objectives such as the provision of clean running water to all households by 2008, decent and safe sanitation by 2010 and electricity for all by 2012.  "
"6004",2005,"Mbeki","We do acknowledge that there have been delays in carrying out some of the programmes. "
"6005",2005,"Mbeki","Further effort will be put into clearing the logjams. "
"6006",2005,"Mbeki","With regard to the provision of safe classrooms, for instance, we had committed ourselves in 2002 to ensure that within three years, no child studied under a tree.  "
"6007",2005,"Mbeki","As the editor of ""City Press"" suggested, our schools infrastructure programme will not be realised even within the set time frame. "
"6008",2005,"Mbeki","The same applies to the commitment we made last year that all schools would have potable water and sanitation by the end of this financial year.  "
"6009",2005,"Mbeki","We will later come back to the challenges of capacity in government, as illustrated by the failure to meet these challenges. "
"6010",2005,"Mbeki","Suffice it to indicate that during the course of this year, we will:  update the schools register of needs and iron out the rough creases among the implementing agents within and across the spheres of government to ensure that we meet the objective of safe classrooms and healthy environments in our schools in as short a time as possible; allocate additional resources over the next three years to cover outstanding claims in the land restitution programme; complete discussions with Eskom, the provincial governments and local municipalities to ensure that free basic electricity is provided to all with the minimum delay; improve the capacity of municipalities to ensure that the target of providing sanitation to 300 000 households per year is met as from 2007; continue the battle to ensure that all citizens have access to affordable medicines; and intensify the programme to refurbish hospitals and provide more professionals especially in rural areas. "
"6011",2005,"Mbeki","We shall also, during the course of this year launch the National Social Security Agency and implement systematic plans against corruption, including with regard to definitions of disability and allocations of the foster care grant.  "
"6012",2005,"Mbeki","In relation to a broader understanding of our society - the macro social state of our nation - research has been completed and discussion has taken place in Cabinet covering such issues as social structure and social mobility; demographics and dynamics with regard to such categories as race, language, religion, gender, age and disability; social organisation in terms of the family and civic participation; as well as matters pertaining to identity and social values. "
"6013",2005,"Mbeki","Government will in the next three months examine the implications of this research on policy and, if necessary, relevant decisions will be taken to enhance our work in strengthening social cohesion.  "
"6014",2005,"Mbeki","Honourable Members;  As we indicated last May, we have set out to ensure that during the Second Decade of Freedom we improve the machinery of government so that wherever we are, each one of us, is inspired to act as servants of the people.  "
"6015",2005,"Mbeki","As we have already indicated, we have started to recruit Community Development Workers. "
"6016",2005,"Mbeki","We want to ensure that Community Development Workers are deployed in each local municipality by March 2006.  "
"6017",2005,"Mbeki","The institution of izimbizo is growing, with a larger number of events involving all spheres of government, better follow-up and greater depth in terms of house-to-house visits. "
"6018",2005,"Mbeki","We have launched the Batho Pele Gateway to afford citizens the platform to access information and, later, services by electronic means.  "
"6019",2005,"Mbeki","Over 65 Multi-Purpose Community Centres have been launched, and by the second half of this year, each district and metropolitan council will have its own centre. "
"6020",2005,"Mbeki","Plans have been approved for the construction of hundreds more such centres, so that by the end of the decade, each municipality would have a one-stop government hub.  "
"6021",2005,"Mbeki","In order to ensure effective leadership of the public service, we have completed a review of skills and levels of competence within the Senior Management Service. "
"6022",2005,"Mbeki","Plans will be put in place to fill the gaps where they exist.  "
"6023",2005,"Mbeki","At local government level, more than 80% of Ward Committees have been set up. "
"6024",2005,"Mbeki","Work is continuing to ensure their proper functioning. "
"6025",2005,"Mbeki","Through Project Consolidate, 136 municipalities at risk are being assisted to put their houses in order. "
"6026",2005,"Mbeki","Because of our appreciation of the centrality of local government to service delivery, we have ensured the doubling of the municipal budget over the past eight years. "
"6027",2005,"Mbeki","We will continue to increase the resources available to local government.  "
"6028",2005,"Mbeki","To improve integration among all spheres of government in both policy development and implementation, the Inter-Governmental Relations Bill has been finalised, and is awaiting processing by the two houses of our national parliament. "
"6029",2005,"Mbeki","This will be complemented by the alignment of spatial and development strategies and planning cycles among all the three spheres of government.  "
"6030",2005,"Mbeki","Certainly it is a reflection of weaknesses in the governance system that the plans to build school infrastructure are unfolding at a much slower pace than envisaged. "
"6031",2005,"Mbeki","The public sector as a whole cannot claim to be such, if the benefits of free basic electricity are accruing mainly to those who are relatively well off. "
"6032",2005,"Mbeki","That only 56% of the Municipal Infrastructure Grant had been allocated to municipalities by December is a reflection of lack of all-round capacity particularly in technical areas with regard to water, sanitation and public works projects.  "
"6033",2005,"Mbeki","And the laborious decision-making process is not helping either.  "
"6034",2005,"Mbeki","We can refer to the provision of services across all the spheres or weaknesses in the implementation of the urban renewal and rural development programmes, and the conclusion will be the same. "
"6035",2005,"Mbeki","We need massively to improve the management, organisational, technical and other capacities of government so that it meets its objectives.  "
"6036",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, the following programme will be implemented during the course of the coming year:  By May, the Forum of SA Directors-General will submit to Cabinet a thorough review of the functioning of the government system as a whole, and make proposals particularly on the capacity of the implementing agents, skills and competence within the public service, alignment of planning and implementation, and issues pertaining to the mobilisation of the public service to speed up social transformation.  "
"6037",2005,"Mbeki","By the end of the year, an improved Batho Pele campaign, including unannounced site visits, name badges, and enhanced internal communication within the public service will be visibly asserted. "
"6038",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, we need to have an on-going national programme to entrench the ethos of Letsema and Vuk'uzenzele among all our people and ensure that these values permeate the work of government, business, labour and communities.  "
"6039",2005,"Mbeki","In this context, we must also make a determined effort to educate our population that our country does not have the resources immediately to meet, simultaneously, all the admittedly urgent needs of our people, especially the poor. "
"6040",2005,"Mbeki","All of us must understand the stark reality that even illegal violent demonstrations will not produce these resources, and will be met with the full force of the law. "
"6041",2005,"Mbeki","At the same time, we have to deal with those within the public service who, because of their negligence and tardiness, deny many of our people services due to them, in instances where resources have been made available to deliver these services.  "
"6042",2005,"Mbeki","The programme to improve services through Gateway and Multi-Purpose Community Centres will be intensified.  "
"6043",2005,"Mbeki","By June this year, the plan to improve monitoring and evaluation across government, including the electronic information management system will have been completed for phased implementation.  "
"6044",2005,"Mbeki","We shall also intensify the programme to expand employment in the public service, particularly among the police, education and health professionals as well as sections providing economic services across all spheres.  "
"6045",2005,"Mbeki","During the course of this year we will speed up the implementation of the comprehensive plan to improve the capacity of the National Statistics System, including Statistics SA.  "
"6046",2005,"Mbeki","By June this year, we will complete the review of gender balances as well as representation of people with disability within the public service, against the targets that government had set itself. "
"6047",2005,"Mbeki","We do hope that, as part of their own contribution to the transformation of South African society, and in the context of the obligation to meet the requirements of our laws, the private sector will do the same.  "
"6048",2005,"Mbeki","Collectively, we need to fight the tendency to act according to particular stereotypes, described so succinctly by Steven Friedman, an analyst at the Centre for Policy Studies:  ""In business and the professions too deeply pervasive prejudices decide who has ability and who not. ... "
"6049",2005,"Mbeki","[I]t is dressed up as support for 'merit' and it infests the thinking of many who believe, genuinely, that they are not prejudiced. ..."
"6050",2005,"Mbeki","And the effect in lost performance, loss of self-esteem and anger from the thwarted is much the same. "
"6051",2005,"Mbeki","It may well cost us far more lost growth and achievement than all the other factors we often cite.""  "
"6052",2005,"Mbeki","Within 3 months, a Summit on Corruption will be convened to review experiences across all sectors of society and agree on a programme to strengthen the campaign, including structures set up to deal with this challenge.  "
"6053",2005,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker;  Two weeks ago, on the 28th of January we celebrated the day on which, ten years ago, the South African Police Service Act was promulgated. "
"6054",2005,"Mbeki","Government took the decision to declare this our National Police Day not only to mark the formal establishment of a new Police Service of a democratic South Africa, but also to pay tribute to the men and women who have put their lives on the line in defence of the safety and security of the citizens.  "
"6055",2005,"Mbeki","Let me take this opportunity once more to congratulate the management and our Police Service as a whole, and reassure them that their efforts are appreciated by all law-abiding South Africans and that we shall continue to work with them to protect the security and dignity of all who live in South Africa.  "
"6056",2005,"Mbeki","The progress that we are making in dealing with crime is manifest in the ongoing reduction in the rates especially of the most serious crimes.  "
"6057",2005,"Mbeki","The trend in the past financial year which has seen the rate of such crimes as murder decline by 8%, theft of motor vehicles and motor cycles by 5,4%, common robbery by 5,9%, cash-in-transit heists by 48,7% and bank robberies by 57,5% should continue and in fact improve in subsequent years.  "
"6058",2005,"Mbeki","Yes there are crimes such as aggravated robbery and child abuse, which show an increase. "
"6059",2005,"Mbeki","Yes the level of crime, especially violent incidents, remains unacceptable. "
"6060",2005,"Mbeki","But we are confident of meeting our target to reduce the rate of contact crimes by 7-10% per year.  "
"6061",2005,"Mbeki","As planned, the security agencies have set up Task Teams to identify, apprehend and convict the gang leaders of organised crime and other perpetrators of serious crimes. "
"6062",2005,"Mbeki","Of those involved in organised crime, 67 out of 96 identified have been arrested. "
"6063",2005,"Mbeki","The same deserved fate has befallen 40 out of 42 identified for commercial crimes involving cases above R5 million and other projects valued at R50 million. 61 of the 62 involved in violent crime including cash-in-transit and other robberies as well as serial murder and serial rape have been arrested. "
"6064",2005,"Mbeki","In brief, 168 of the Top 200 identified have been apprehended.  "
"6065",2005,"Mbeki","In terms of the methodology of the Police Service, to identify a broader group of top criminals using criteria related to repeat offending, the net of our intense focus will be cast wider so as to include individuals and gangs whose arrest is sure to improve the safety of communities in all regions of the country.  "
"6066",2005,"Mbeki","As Honourable Members would know, an additional allocation of R2, 3 billion was announced last October to improve the salaries of members of the police service. "
"6067",2005,"Mbeki","I am pleased to indicate that more resources will be added to what has already been allocated. "
"6068",2005,"Mbeki","Further, to improve our capacity to fight crime, an additional 8 000 members and 3 000 support staff have been recruited into the Service since May 2004.  "
"6069",2005,"Mbeki","At the same time, in the period since our last address to this joint sitting, we have completed the terms of reference for the comprehensive review of the criminal justice system, launched the Service Charter for Victims of Crime and started training those who will provide the services that derive from the Charter. "
"6070",2005,"Mbeki","We have also launched three community courts and started 8 pilots in six provinces; and we have started phasing in units of the Police Service for improved border control.  "
"6071",2005,"Mbeki","In the coming year, we shall continue with all these and other programmes, to:  speed up the setting up of community courts beyond the pilot projects so as to have at least 2 such courts per province; give life to the ""victims' charter"" through reorientation of the implementing personnel, information to citizens and, where applicable, legislation to regulate this service; expand the number of police areas for focussed multi-disciplinary interventions from 63 to 169; strengthen partnerships with business and communities, including the expansion of the coverage of close-circuit television in more metropolitan centres; further improve law-enforcement and security at ports of entry; improve monitoring of case loads to reduce case cycle time, and improve performance of justice officers through the revitalisation of the Justice College; rapidly reduce the number of children in police and prison custody with emphasis on KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and Gauteng Provinces; complete, by April 2007 four additional Correctional facilities while introducing a new ethos in the treatment of offenders in order to reduce recidivism; operationalise more sexual offences courts, taking into account that the conviction rate in these courts, (at 62%), is much higher than in ordinary courts (at 42%), and improve the capacity of all dedicated courts, including those dealing with car hijacking; and review the Foreign Military Assistance Act in order to discourage, for their own good and the good of the country, those who seek to profit from conflict and human suffering such as in Iraq. "
"6072",2005,"Mbeki","We shall do all this, Madame Speaker, conscious of the responsibility that we have not only to our own citizens, but also to the rest of humanity in pursuing the goal of a better world.  "
"6073",2005,"Mbeki","In the first instance, our greatest challenge in this regard is to consolidate the African agenda, and we can draw inspiration from the many positive developments on the continent since we addressed the Joint Sitting of Parliament last May.  "
"6074",2005,"Mbeki","In our regional community, SADC, the people of Botswana, Mozambique and Namibia have held yet new democratic elections. "
"6075",2005,"Mbeki","In Mozambique and Namibia they also ensured the passing of the baton of leadership in an exemplary manner. "
"6076",2005,"Mbeki","Progress is being made to strengthen SADC, and we are honoured that South Africa currently chairs the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security. "
"6077",2005,"Mbeki","We are pleased with the progress being made towards the formation of the SADC Peacekeeping Brigade, which will form part of the AU Standby Force.  "
"6078",2005,"Mbeki","Today South Africa enjoys the singular honour of being the permanent venue for the Pan-African Parliament, and we form part of the AU Peace and Security Council. "
"6079",2005,"Mbeki","We thank the President of the Pan African Parliament for her presence in the House today.  "
"6080",2005,"Mbeki","During the coming year, we shall continue to strengthen our contribution to the efforts of humanity to build a world in which each can feel a sense of belonging enjoying an improving quality of life.  "
"6081",2005,"Mbeki","In addition to the ongoing tasks already identified in the programme presented last May:  We will ensure more deliberate application to the task of revamping SADC management structures, and speeding up the integration of our economies on the sub-continent, including the implementation of infrastructure projects already identified with regard to transport and energy;  We will finalise our preparations for South Africa's Peer Review assessment, working with partners in civil society. "
"6082",2005,"Mbeki","We will also play our part in ensuring a successful launch of the continent-wide civil society council, the AU ECOSOCC, during the course of this month.  "
"6083",2005,"Mbeki","We also wish to pay tribute to our National Defence Force for the consistent role they are playing as part of the midwives of peace, stability and prosperity in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Darfur in the Sudan. "
"6084",2005,"Mbeki","With regard to the DRC and Burundi in particular, they have contributed to the fact that we can speak with some measure of confidence that our brothers and sisters in these countries will, this year, at last exercise their right to choose governments based on the will of the people.  "
"6085",2005,"Mbeki","It is our fervent wish - and we shall continue to contribute to the achievement of this objective - that the leaders and people of Côte d'Ivoire find one another to implement all the necessary steps to end the crisis in their country, creating the possibility for the holding of democratic Presidential elections in October this year in a unified country.  "
"6086",2005,"Mbeki","The current unconstitutional charade in Togo, following the death of President Eyadema, which ECOWAS and the AU are confronting firmly, adds to instability in West Africa. "
"6087",2005,"Mbeki","This must communicate the message to the people of Cote d'Ivoire and the rest of our continent that everything must be done to solve the Ivorian crisis, given the importance of this country, which has the third largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa.  "
"6088",2005,"Mbeki","We shall continue to work with the government and people of Zimbabwe, as part of the SADC collective, to ensure that the elections they are to hold in less than two months are free and fair.  "
"6089",2005,"Mbeki","We shall also continue our engagement with the Kingdom of Swaziland to help where we can in the efforts to construct a constitutional dispensation that enjoys the confidence of all.  "
"6090",2005,"Mbeki","We have begun to do our work as the Convenor of the Sudan Post-Conflict Reconstruction Committee of the AU, and will focus on this task to contribute to the successful implementation of the vitally important Sudan peace settlement signed last month in Nairobi.  "
"6091",2005,"Mbeki","We have also taken the first steps to engage the new government of Somalia, at the request of its President, to assist in the challenging process of the reconstitution of what had become a failed state.  "
"6092",2005,"Mbeki","We shall continue playing our role to ensure the success of the AU and its programme, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). "
"6093",2005,"Mbeki","Our Finance Minister and other African leaders serve on the Africa Commission established by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who will chair both the G8 and European Union this year, and whose objective is to ensure the effective implementation of the G8 Africa Action Plan adopted by the G8 governments to support NEPAD.  "
"6094",2005,"Mbeki","We will continue to work with the UK and other members of the G8 to ensure that the July Summit Meeting of this Group produces the practical results with regard to the NEPAD and G8 Africa Action Plan objectives already agreed between Africa and the G8.  "
"6095",2005,"Mbeki","Madam Speaker;  South Africa has had the privilege, in the past eight months, to host President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti and his family, fulfilling our responsibility to Africa and the African Diaspora. "
"6096",2005,"Mbeki","We are indeed very happy that President and Mrs Aristide are with us in this House today. "
"6097",2005,"Mbeki","To contribute to efforts aimed at ensuring that the people of Haiti know peace and prosperity, we are working with the African Union, the Caribbean Community and the United Nations to normalise the situation in that country so that democratic elections can be held later this year, as scheduled. "
"6098",2005,"Mbeki","In the next two months, we will take part in a Caribbean Diaspora Conference, which we hope will lead to a Global Conference in the near future.  "
"6099",2005,"Mbeki","Last year we hosted the Afro-Asian solidarity organisation, AASROC, and the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement. "
"6100",2005,"Mbeki","Beyond the formal interactions that take place at this level, there could not have been a better expression of human solidarity than the enthusiastic response of South Africans, to the devastation caused by the seaquake and ensuing tsunami in Asia and the northeastern shelf of Africa. "
"6101",2005,"Mbeki","We again express our solidarity with the affected nations, and the families of South Africans who lost their loved ones, and pledge to contribute what we can to ease their plight.  "
"6102",2005,"Mbeki","We shall also take part in the Asia-Africa Summit in Bandung, Indonesia in April 2005, both to strengthen ties across the Indian Ocean, and to mark the 50th anniversary of the famous Bandung Conference, which made a decisive contribution to the strengthening of Afro-Asian solidarity in the anti-colonial struggle, and led directly to the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement.  "
"6103",2005,"Mbeki","In the next two months, we shall host the Ministerial Trilateral Commission meeting of India, Brazil and South Africa, to review these strategic relations focused on building South-South co-operation. "
"6104",2005,"Mbeki","In the same vein, we will continue to strengthen our bilateral relations with the People's Republic of China.  "
"6105",2005,"Mbeki","Some three months ago, the national liberation movement and the world at large lost one of its eminent leaders, President Yasser Arafat. "
"6106",2005,"Mbeki","We wish once more to pay tribute to this outstanding son of the Palestinian people, and to wish the new Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, the peoples of Palestine and Israel lasting peace in states that co-exist in conditions of security for all, cooperation and human solidarity.  "
"6107",2005,"Mbeki","I would also like to take advantage of this occasion warmly to congratulate and salute Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for the bold steps they have taken during the last few days to communicate a firm message of hope to their respective peoples. "
"6108",2005,"Mbeki","I would like to assure them that in this regard, they have the unequivocal support of our government and the overwhelming majority of our people.  "
"6109",2005,"Mbeki","We also salute the invaluable contribution made by President Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan to this happy development. "
"6110",2005,"Mbeki","Similarly, we are pleased to acknowledge and welcome the resolve publicly communicated by President George W. "
"6111",2005,"Mbeki","Bush and the new U.S. "
"6112",2005,"Mbeki","Secretary of State, Dr Condoleeza Rice, to do everything possible to implement the Road Map for the speedy resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict within the context of a two-state solution.  "
"6113",2005,"Mbeki","We also wish the people of Iraq success in their march towards lasting peace in the context of a fully restored sovereignty and a united, democratic Iraq, strengthened by the diversity of its population.  "
"6114",2005,"Mbeki","We will also continue to work with the Government of Iran and the rest of the world community to find a lasting solution to the dispute that has arisen over issues related to the uses of nuclear technology.  "
"6115",2005,"Mbeki","We shall also continue to work with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and other states for global consensus in the restructuring of this body so that it plays its due role as the ultimate and inclusive authority on global governance and development.  "
"6116",2005,"Mbeki","This will be given further impetus when later this year, South Africa hosts the annual conference on Progressive Governance, bringing together distinguished world leaders who have the interests of the poor and the marginalised at heart.  "
"6117",2005,"Mbeki","We shall intensify our efforts to build a global movement of human solidarity. "
"6118",2005,"Mbeki","In this regard, we shall build on the groundswell of global appreciation and solidarity that characterised the celebration of our First Decade of Freedom.  "
"6119",2005,"Mbeki","It is also in this context that we shall intensify our efforts, working with the rest of Africa and the Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA) to prepare for the 2010 Soccer World Cup, confident that the trust placed in us by leaders of the ""beautiful game"" shall be validated in every way.  "
"6120",2005,"Mbeki","I am pleased to welcome to our country the world's leading women golfers who begin the Women's World Cup of Golf tournament in George today, and wish our team success in its effort to emerge as the World Champion. "
"6121",2005,"Mbeki","Our best wishes also go to the Proteas cricket team to vanquish their English opponents in the current limited overs matches.  "
"6122",2005,"Mbeki","Honourable Members;  We are not being arrogant or complacent when we assert that our country, as a united nation, has never in its entire history enjoyed such a confluence of encouraging possibilities. "
"6123",2005,"Mbeki","On behalf of our government, we commend our programme to the country, confident that its implementation will help to place us on the high road towards ensuring that we become a winning nation and that we play our role towards the renewal of Africa and the creation of a better world.  "
"6124",2005,"Mbeki","Acting together, we do have the capacity to realise these objectives. "
"6125",2005,"Mbeki","And sparing neither effort nor strength, we can and shall build a South Africa that truly belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity!  "
"6126",2005,"Mbeki","Thank you. "

"6128",2004,"Mbeki","I am honoured to welcome to this Chamber representatives of two families whose loved ones were killed 30 years ago in Gaborone, Botswana, and Lusaka, Zambia, while opening what proved to be parcel bombs sent by agents of the apartheid system. "
"6129",2004,"Mbeki","These were Onkgopotse Tiro, a leader of the South African Students Organisation (SASO), and Adolphus Mvemve then Chief Representative of the ANC in Zambia. "
"6130",2004,"Mbeki","I am very pleased that they were able to join us today.  "
"6131",2004,"Mbeki","Nelson Mandela delivered our first State of the Nation Address before the first democratically elected parliament on the 24th of May, 1994. "
"6132",2004,"Mbeki","In that Address he quoted from a poem by Ingrid Jonker.  "
"6133",2004,"Mbeki","In that poem Ingrid Jonker said:  ""the child is present at all assemblies and law-giving the child peers through the windows of houses and into the hearts of mothers this child who only wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere  the child grown to a man treks on through all Africa the child grown to a giant journeys over the whole world without a pass!""  "
"6134",2004,"Mbeki","Nelson Mandela then went on to say:  ""And in this glorious vision, she instructs that our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child.  "
"6135",2004,"Mbeki","""It is these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government.  "
"6136",2004,"Mbeki","""And so we must, constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.  "
"6137",2004,"Mbeki","""The government I have the honour to lead and I dare say the masses who elected us to serve in this role, are inspired by the single vision of creating a people-centred society.  "
"6138",2004,"Mbeki","""Accordingly, the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.  "
"6139",2004,"Mbeki","""The acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate, the government institutions we create, the legislation we adopt, must be whether they serve these objectives.""  "
"6140",2004,"Mbeki","Today we begin the last session of our Second Democratic Parliament. "
"6141",2004,"Mbeki","We begin this session two-and-half months before we celebrate our First Decade of Liberation and Democracy. "
"6142",2004,"Mbeki","We also meet in these Houses of Parliament not long before we hold our third general elections.  "
"6143",2004,"Mbeki","It is therefore natural that our national legislature should spend some time reflecting on what we have achieved and not achieved during the last ten years. "
"6144",2004,"Mbeki","Inevitably, all of us will also make speeches aimed at improving our fortunes in the forthcoming elections.  "
"6145",2004,"Mbeki","But perhaps the correct starting point for the government would be to recall what was said as we began our journey into our democratic future. "
"6146",2004,"Mbeki","It was for this reason that I quoted what President Mandela said at the start of the first session of the first democratic parliament.  "
"6147",2004,"Mbeki","To repeat what he said:  ""The government I have the honour to lead and I dare say the masses who elected us to serve in this role, are inspired by the single vision of creating a people-centred society.  "
"6148",2004,"Mbeki","""Accordingly, the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.  "
"6149",2004,"Mbeki","""The acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate, the government institutions we create, the legislation we adopt, must be whether they serve these objectives.""  "
"6150",2004,"Mbeki","Sometimes it is difficult fully to understand the fact that we are barely ten years away from a time in the lives of our people when our collective future was very uncertain. "
"6151",2004,"Mbeki","Some among us will hardly remember that even as we met in this House to listen to President Mandela deliver the State of the Nation Address, fellow South Africans were continuing to die as a result of political violence.  "
"6152",2004,"Mbeki","For instance, the South Africa Yearbook 1995 reported that ""Although political violence declined during and after the April 1994 election, extensive criminal and political violence continued to persist in the country, especially in KwaZulu-Natal and on the East Rand of the Gauteng Province."" "
"6153",2004,"Mbeki","Daily fatalities from political violence still numbered six in May and just under four in June.  "
"6154",2004,"Mbeki","Others among us will have forgotten that as we sat here listening to that first State of the Nation Address, the commitment made by President Mandela, to ensure ""the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment"" was to many little more than a promise they appreciated but could not fully comprehend.  "
"6155",2004,"Mbeki","The question had still to be answered as to where the resources would be found to finance the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, of which President Mandela spoke. "
"6156",2004,"Mbeki","In the decade up to the middle of 1993, the average annual GDP growth rate was less than 1 per cent. "
"6157",2004,"Mbeki","During the first half of 1995, the annualised growth rate stood at 1 per cent. "
"6158",2004,"Mbeki","For the fiscal year 1994/95, the budget deficit stood at 6.6 per cent. "
"6159",2004,"Mbeki","Consumer price inflation in the 12 months up to April 1995 was 11 per cent.  "
"6160",2004,"Mbeki","By the end of that year, the interest rate stood at 13 per cent. "
"6161",2004,"Mbeki","On 14th of February, 1995, the then Governor of the Reserve Bank, Chris Stals, said: ""A more restrictive monetary policy is needed to make sure that the current economic upswing will not be of the boom-bust nature of earlier times, but will be more durable.""  "
"6162",2004,"Mbeki","On the 29th of June of the same year, Mr Stals sounded an ominous note when he said: ""Underlying inflationary pressures are undoubtedly increasing again in the South African economy..."
"6163",2004,"Mbeki","If left unchecked, this trend will eventually force the abortion of the welcome improvement over the past year in real economic growth, and will frustrate the objectives of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.""  "
"6164",2004,"Mbeki","On the 28th of August, 1995, Chris Stals said: ""Basically, the South African economy is not competitive enough to enable it to maintain an economic growth rate at a level high enough for its own needs. "
"6165",2004,"Mbeki","More drastic economic restructuring will be needed to lift the growth potential of the economy to the desired and more acceptable level.""  "
"6166",2004,"Mbeki","In the same speech, he expressed the uncertainties of the day when he said: ""Economic growth will, in the final situation, be dependent not only on an improvement in the economic structure of the country, but even more so on political and social stability. "
"6167",2004,"Mbeki","In the final situation, all business decisions are influenced by the overall environment in which they are taken.""  "
"6168",2004,"Mbeki","On the 12th of October, 1995, he said that the country was still faced with some political uncertainties, which impacted on our economic prospects. "
"6169",2004,"Mbeki","He said:  ""At this stage...the country still has to face:  the first fully democratic election for local authorities scheduled to take place in early November this year; a more clear definition of the political, economic and financial relationships between the central government and regional governments; and, the drafting of a final Constitution to replace the current Interim Constitution before the next general election can take place."" "
"6170",2004,"Mbeki","Since time immemorial, the overwhelming majority of our people had known nothing but despair. "
"6171",2004,"Mbeki","They knew this as an incontestable matter of fact that tomorrow would not be better than yesterday; it was also fixed and given that the following day would be worse. "
"6172",2004,"Mbeki","But then, April 27, 1994 came and things changed radically and irrevocably for all South Africans.  "
"6173",2004,"Mbeki","For the black, and especially African majority, suddenly a new dawn broke. "
"6174",2004,"Mbeki","After these masses had cast their votes, they still had nothing in their stomachs and their pockets. "
"6175",2004,"Mbeki","They walked away from the polling booths to return to their miserable shacks, their children made listless by hunger and the brutish thugs who prowled the unlit dirt roads of the shantytown, ready to pounce on their victims with no sense of mercy.  "
"6176",2004,"Mbeki","They walked the long distances to return to their homesteads of rural squalor, to the mornings of the drudgery of women with buckets full of dirty river water on their heads, to the daily diet of mealie-pap, to the dark, still and menacing nights broken only by the weak flickering light of the paraffin lamp and the dying embers of an exhausted fire on the humble hearth.  "
"6177",2004,"Mbeki","But yet they had a spring in their step because they knew that a new dawn had proclaimed the coming of a bright day. "
"6178",2004,"Mbeki","Though their hands carried the emptiness to which generations of deprivation had accustomed them, their hearts and minds were fired up by a new-found sense of hope and the attendant feeling of dread lest that hope turned out to be but a mere mirage, the false creation of a wish that was intensely felt.  "
"6179",2004,"Mbeki","The experience of many decades had taught us to understand that the black poor of our country valued a just peace as deeply as they valued their lives. "
"6180",2004,"Mbeki","It had taught us that their sense of pride in themselves as human beings made it impossible for them to join in a mass slaughter of other human beings, even to satisfy the base instincts of vengeance and retaliating to settle scores.  "
"6181",2004,"Mbeki","Over many decades, we had seen that these masses would always refuse to turn racist simply because they were subjected to cruel, racist rule. "
"6182",2004,"Mbeki","When a hero in their midst, Chris Hani, was murdered in cold blood, they refused to fulfil the prophesy of the poet that the blood-dimmed tide would be loosed, to drown the ceremony of innocence.  "
"6183",2004,"Mbeki","They stood in the voting lines side by side with those who had been their oppressors, and never uttered a single word of anger, nor jostled their white person next to them because they felt that their time to become the new masters had come. "
"6184",2004,"Mbeki","Black and white stood together, acting voluntarily together for the first time in our history, together to give birth to a new social order that would serve the interests of all our people.  "
"6185",2004,"Mbeki","When the leadership of these black masses said to them that, despite the fact that their children, their brothers and sisters, their mothers and fathers had been slaughtered in Boipatong and elsewhere on the many killing fields in our country, they as leaders, were obliged to pursue the peaceful advance to a just peace, these masses agreed and urged that the dialogue chamber should bring to the nation the gift of a just peace.  "
"6186",2004,"Mbeki","They thought and acted as they did because they knew better than those who had been certified as learned, that it was only a just peace that would end their despair and bring into their lives the sense of hope that would make it possible for them to bear the pain of hunger, until the day came when they would no longer go hungry.  "
"6187",2004,"Mbeki","It was for these reasons that they had fought, ready to sacrifice their lives, for the just peace and the sense of hope they saw as the necessary condition for their survival as human beings. "
"6188",2004,"Mbeki","Those among us who are fond of threatening violence to promote their causes, should learn to know this, that the masses of our people are ready and willing to sacrifice once again, to defend the peace and keep alive the sense of hope that enables them to behave in mysteriously miraculous ways.  "
"6189",2004,"Mbeki","I must presume that many of us read the moving article by Rian Malan published last Sunday. "
"6190",2004,"Mbeki","He says:  ""On this day, 10 years ago, I was hiding gold coins under floorboards and trying to get my hands on a gun before the balloon went up. "
"6191",2004,"Mbeki","As a white South African, I was fully expecting war as right-wing boers and Bantustan chiefs conspired to annihilate Nelson Mandela's people and the ANC leader squabbled with President FW de Klerk over who deserved more credit for their shared Nobel Peace Prize.  "
"6192",2004,"Mbeki","""In my view, peace would never come. "
"6193",2004,"Mbeki","There was too much history, too much pain and anger...  "
"6194",2004,"Mbeki","""Ten days before the predicted apocalypse, there came a miraculous reprieve. "
"6195",2004,"Mbeki","A reverent quiet settled upon the nation, and the election passed off entirely peacefully...  "
"6196",2004,"Mbeki","""I set out to discredit the outcome. "
"6197",2004,"Mbeki","The peace is illusory, I sneered; anarchy is still coming. "
"6198",2004,"Mbeki","Look at crime! "
"6199",2004,"Mbeki","Rape! "
"6200",2004,"Mbeki","Guns and mayhem! "
"6201",2004,"Mbeki","Decaying cities! "
"6202",2004,"Mbeki","Abandoned factories! "
"6203",2004,"Mbeki","Incompetence and corruption everywhere! "
"6204",2004,"Mbeki","When our new rulers dismissed such criticism as racist, I said, fine: if that's the price one pays for speaking the truth, I will consider myself honoured and continue. "
"6205",2004,"Mbeki","Hospitals don't work anymore! "
"6206",2004,"Mbeki","Surly nurses! "
"6207",2004,"Mbeki","Drunken teachers! "
"6208",2004,"Mbeki","A civil service where the phones just ring!""  "
"6209",2004,"Mbeki","He ends his personal testimony with these words:  ""It is infinitely worse to receive than to give, especially if one is arrogant and the gift is something big, like mercy or forgiveness. "
"6210",2004,"Mbeki","The gift of 1994 was so huge that I choked on it and couldn't say thank you. "
"6211",2004,"Mbeki","But I am not too proud to say it now.""  "
"6212",2004,"Mbeki","I have borrowed these honest words from Rian Malan to tell the painful story that strangely, but not surprisingly, because of April 27, 1994, our Freedom Day, despair had changed its domicile. "
"6213",2004,"Mbeki","Now, because freedom for all our people had become the defining feature of our reality, those who had rejoiced in the supremacy of their race opened their doors to despair.  "
"6214",2004,"Mbeki","Those who had had despair imposed upon them, rejoiced in the triumph of the angel of hope, that brought a new life of a shared neighbourhood to all our people, no longer fractured by high, fortified walls of hatred, fear and mistrust.  "
"6215",2004,"Mbeki","But this too, the transference of the burden of despair, became part of the reality that the new democratic order had to address. "
"6216",2004,"Mbeki","It became part of what had to be done to achieve what President Mandela foretold, when he spoke from this podium about the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, and the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.  "
"6217",2004,"Mbeki","Almost ten years after its liberation from white minority rule, our country still faces many challenges. "
"6218",2004,"Mbeki","Many of our people are unemployed. "
"6219",2004,"Mbeki","Many of our people continue to live in poverty. "
"6220",2004,"Mbeki","Violence against the person in all its forms continues to plague especially those sections of our population that are poor and live in socially depressed communities.  "
"6221",2004,"Mbeki","The burden of disease impacting on our people, including AIDS, continues to be a matter of serious concern, as do issues that relate to the fact that many of our people, including the youth, lack the education and skills that our economy and society needs.  "
"6222",2004,"Mbeki","There are still many of our people who live in shacks and others who have no access to clean water, proper sanitation and electricity. "
"6223",2004,"Mbeki","Imbalances and inequalities that impact on fellow citizens on the basis of race, gender and geographic dispersal continue to persist.  "
"6224",2004,"Mbeki","In the 1994 State of the Nation Address to which we have referred, President Mandela said: ""We have learnt the lesson that our blemishes speak of what all humanity should not do."" "
"6225",2004,"Mbeki","The point we have sought to make in the last few minutes in referring to the challenges we continue to face, is that the blemishes of which Madiba spoke continue to disfigure our society. "
"6226",2004,"Mbeki","We have not as yet eradicated the cruel legacy we inherited that he characterised as the blemishes that all humanity should avoid.  "
"6227",2004,"Mbeki","However, despite this reality, the answer we have given and will continue to give to the question whether we have made progress with regard to the fundamental tasks of which Nelson Mandela spoke on the 24th of May, 1994, is a resounding - yes!  "
"6228",2004,"Mbeki","Together with all other objective observers of social development, we have always known that our country's blemishes produced by more than three centuries of colonialism and apartheid could not be removed in one decade. "
"6229",2004,"Mbeki","Nevertheless, we have no hesitation in saying that we have made great advances to ensure the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, and the continuous extension of the frontiers of the freedom, of which Nelson Mandela spoke almost ten years ago.  "
"6230",2004,"Mbeki","The statistics and concrete information of which the Honourable Members, the distinguished guests and our country are familiar, tell the real story of what we have done and had to do to create the people-centred society that has been central to the work of both our first and second democratic governments.  "
"6231",2004,"Mbeki","This real story is that before 1994:  Estimates of the housing backlog ranged from 1,4 million to 3 million units and people living in shacks were between 5 million to 7,7 million; 60% of the population of South Africa had no access to electricity; 16 million people had no access to clean water; 22 million people did not have access to adequate sanitation; There were 17 fragmented departments of education with a disproportionate allocation of resources to white schools; There was 70% secondary school enrolment. "
"6232",2004,"Mbeki","A decade later:  About 1,9 million housing subsidies have been provided and 1,6 million houses built for the poor of our country; More than 70% households have been electrified; 9 million additional people now have access to clean water; 63% of households now have access to sanitation; There has been a successful formation of an integrated education system, even though there is a clear need for more resource allocation and capacity building in poor areas; Nutrition and early childhood interventions have been established to improve better results for children from poor backgrounds; By 2002 secondary school enrolment had reached 85%. "
"6233",2004,"Mbeki","Again, the real story of our country tells us that 10 years ago:  South Africa was in its twenty-first year of double-digit inflation; The country had had three years of negative growth - the economy and the wealth of the nation was shrinking; South Africa had experienced more than a decade of declining growth per capita - the average income of South Africans had been falling since the 1980's and the overall wealth of the country declined by nearly one-third; From 1985 to the middle of 1994, total net capital outflow from our country amounted to almost R50 billion. "
"6234",2004,"Mbeki","Government had run up a budget deficit equal to 9,5% of the GDP, including the debt of the so-called independent homelands; The net open forward position of the South African Reserve Bank was $25 billion in deficit; Public sector debt was equal to 64% of the GDP. "
"6235",2004,"Mbeki","It is this unhealthy economic situation that led Chris Stals to make the observations to which we have referred.  "
"6236",2004,"Mbeki","A decade later:  Inflation is down to four percent if you use the CPIX or less than one percent if you use the CPI index; The country is experiencing the longest period of consistent positive growth since the GDP was properly recorded in the 1940's; The net open forward position of the South African Reserve Bank rose to $4,7 billion in surplus by the end of last year; Public sector debt has come down to less than 50% of GDP. "
"6237",2004,"Mbeki","Since 2001, we have engaged our people in the various provinces in the process of Izimbizo, the 7th and latest being KwaZulu-Natal. "
"6238",2004,"Mbeki","By this means we have sought to deepen the interaction between the national government and the masses of our people. "
"6239",2004,"Mbeki","The national ministers, provincial and local governments have also carried out their own imbizo campaigns for the same reason.  "
"6240",2004,"Mbeki","We have just presented some of the statistics that tell part of the story of our progress during our first decade of freedom towards the creation of a people-centred society. "
"6241",2004,"Mbeki","The imbizo process has given us an excellent opportunity to hear directly from the people what these figures mean to them.  "
"6242",2004,"Mbeki","It has been truly inspiring to hear directly from the people as they expressed their concerns, communicated their aspirations and made suggestions of what needs to be done to take us further forward to meet the needs of the people.  "
"6243",2004,"Mbeki","These masses, essentially, but not exclusively, the poor of our country, invariably speak well of the improvements to the quality of their lives that have occurred during the last ten years. "
"6244",2004,"Mbeki","They talk about the increased access to better housing, water, electricity, roads, land, school meals and social grants. "
"6245",2004,"Mbeki","But these masses are equally insistent about the need for all of us to act together to address the outstanding challenges. "
"6246",2004,"Mbeki","Regularly they raise the issue of the need for jobs and the need to provide appropriate training especially for the youth to ensure that on completing their school years, they are able to find employment. "
"6247",2004,"Mbeki","Like others of our rural communities, rural KwaZulu-Natal called on the government to help with the provision of tractors and seed to assist the people to till the soil.  "
"6248",2004,"Mbeki","The people have not hesitated to make frank and critical assessments especially of the quality of service delivery in their localities, as well as the performance of the municipal councillors. "
"6249",2004,"Mbeki","They also boldly raise other questions, such as crime, health matters and instances of perceived or actual corruption and malpractice.  "
"6250",2004,"Mbeki","On Thursday last week we were at Msinga in KwaZulu-Natal. "
"6251",2004,"Mbeki","One of the participants at the imbizo complained that though people had cellular phones in this rural and mountainous area, they could not use them. "
"6252",2004,"Mbeki","He explained that this was because the cellular phone companies had not erected the necessary masts.  "
"6253",2004,"Mbeki","The staff of the President's Office immediately contacted Vodacom and informed them of the complaint made at the imbizo. "
"6254",2004,"Mbeki","I am very pleased to say that two days ago one of the local leaders at Msinga called to say that the service providers had come to the area within hours, to attend to the complaint. "
"6255",2004,"Mbeki","In less than a week, the people of Msinga had been given the possibility to communicate among themselves and with the rest of the country and the world by telephone.  "
"6256",2004,"Mbeki","We held our last imbizo in KwaZulu-Natal at Gamalakhe near Harding, in the Ugu District Municipality. "
"6257",2004,"Mbeki","At this imbizo a local resident drew our attention to instances of corruption in our prisons. "
"6258",2004,"Mbeki","He then gave us details of his experience of this corruption.  "
"6259",2004,"Mbeki","We have passed these details to Judge Thabane Jali who heads the Judicial Commission investigating malpractices in our correctional system, and who, I understand, is also present in the Chamber. "
"6260",2004,"Mbeki","Again I am pleased to say that within days of receiving this information, Judge Jali has already instructed people assisting him in KwaZulu-Natal to meet the complainant and follow up on his allegations.  "
"6261",2004,"Mbeki","I mention these two instances because they demonstrate both the positive response by the public and private sectors to the call we have made for all our people to work together in the spirit of letsema to tackle the common problems facing our country and people, and the fact that the government takes the imbizo process very seriously and tries at all times to respond to the issues raised by the people, within the context of availability of resources.  "
"6262",2004,"Mbeki","Again, I mention this because some in our country, for reasons best known to themselves, seem very keen to criticise the government's response to the iimbizo on false grounds. "
"6263",2004,"Mbeki","This happened recently when ill-informed allegations were made about commitments we made to the people of Bekkersdal in Gauteng.  "
"6264",2004,"Mbeki","I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Vodacom and Judge Jali and express the hope that others will follow the excellent example they have set for all of us.  "
"6265",2004,"Mbeki","But perhaps more striking than everything we have said so far about the imbizo process has been the palpable sense of confidence among the people in a better future for their country and themselves. "
"6266",2004,"Mbeki","This goes together with the complete absence of any sense of distance or alienation from the government they elected.  "
"6267",2004,"Mbeki","These masses attend the iimbizo confident of their right to communicate directly with their government and certain that the process presents them with a genuine opportunity to have their concerns addressed. "
"6268",2004,"Mbeki","I have listened to our people boldly expressing their views even in areas that not so long ago were paralysed by the fear that to speak one's mind was to invite death.  "
"6269",2004,"Mbeki","This has said to me that we have moved forward most significantly towards the realisation of the objective presented by President Mandela when he committed us to the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.  "
"6270",2004,"Mbeki","Most of us present here will remember that not so long ago, the government and the state were to the masses of our people Public Enemy No 1. "
"6271",2004,"Mbeki","Then, some thought that to advance the demand that the people shall govern was mere rhetoric of politicians hungry for power. "
"6272",2004,"Mbeki","Institutions that were the cause of our despair have today become repositories of hope.  "
"6273",2004,"Mbeki","When we presented the State of the Nation Address to our second democratic parliament on June 25, 1999, we spoke of ""the enormity of the challenge we face to succeed in creating the caring society we have spoken of.""  "
"6274",2004,"Mbeki","We said that ""For this reason this is not a task that can be carried out by the government alone. "
"6275",2004,"Mbeki","The challenge of the reconstruction and development of our society into one which guarantees human dignity, faces the entirety of our people.  "
"6276",2004,"Mbeki","""It is a national task that calls for the mobilisation of the whole nation into united people's action, into a partnership with government for progressive change and a better life for all, for a common effort to build a winning nation.  "
"6277",2004,"Mbeki","""The Government therefore commits itself to work in a close partnership with all our people, inspired by the call - Faranani! -to ensure that we draw on the energy and genius of the nation to give birth to something that will surely be new, good and beautiful.""  "
"6278",2004,"Mbeki","The masses of our people, individuals and institutions, among whom today we cited Judge Thabane Jali and Vodacom, are responding magnificently to the call we repeat today and will repeat in future - Faranani!  "
"6279",2004,"Mbeki","In a few months time, we will return to these Chambers to inaugurate our third democratic parliament. "
"6280",2004,"Mbeki","Whoever will be President then will deliver yet another State of the Nation Address. "
"6281",2004,"Mbeki","That will provide an opportunity to address the more detailed issues on the government's programme as well as matters that will be covered in the Budget Speech and the Medium Term Revenue and Expenditure perspectives that will support the government's actions as our country begins its Second Decade of Democracy.  "
"6282",2004,"Mbeki","Today we present the longer-term perspective for the continued transformation of our country that will and must be based on our country's achievements during its First Decade of Liberation. "
"6283",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, we would like to restate this matter unequivocally that the policies we required to translate what President Mandela said in May 1994 are firmly in place.  "
"6284",2004,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we do not foresee that there will be any need for new and major policy initiatives. "
"6285",2004,"Mbeki","The task we will all face during the decade ahead will be to ensure the vigorous implementation of these policies, to create the winning people-centred society of which Nelson Mandela spoke.  "
"6286",2004,"Mbeki","If I may say this, creating that winning nation must include greatly improved organisation, management and performance by all the national teams, Bafana Bafana, the Springboks, the Proteas and our athletics teams.  "
"6287",2004,"Mbeki","The work we will do must move our country forward decisively towards the eradication of poverty and underdevelopment in our country. "
"6288",2004,"Mbeki","We must achieve further and visible advances with regard to the improvement of the quality of life of all our people, affecting many critical areas of social existence, including health, safety and security, moral regeneration, social cohesion, opening the doors of culture and education to all, and sport and recreation.  "
"6289",2004,"Mbeki","We will have to score new victories in the struggle to create an egalitarian society, successfully addressing the important challenges of persisting racial and gender inequalities, the disempowerment of our youth and people with disabilities, and proper care for children and the elderly.  "
"6290",2004,"Mbeki","We must ensure that our country and people are properly positioned within the global community of nations, fully understanding and responding to the diverse political, economic, social and technological challenges of the process of globalisation. "
"6291",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, we will have to persist in the work we are doing towards the regeneration of Africa and the construction of a new and more equitable world order.  "
"6292",2004,"Mbeki","The advances we must record demand that we ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities to our people as a critical player in the process of the growth, reconstruction and development of our country. "
"6293",2004,"Mbeki","In particular this will require that we further strengthen our system of local government and ensure that the system of traditional government plays the role ascribed to it in our Constitution and legislation.  "
"6294",2004,"Mbeki","We must achieve greater progress with regard to the integration of our system of governance, achieving seamless cooperation both within and among all spheres of government. "
"6295",2004,"Mbeki","At the same time, we must further consolidate the practice of creating public-private partnerships and building government-civil society cooperation, to ensure that we utilise our collective capacities to give further impetus to the overall development and transformation of our country.  "
"6296",2004,"Mbeki","With regard to the public sector, I would like to take this opportunity to salute and thank especially the cadre of public sector managers and leaders that has emerged over the last decade, many of whom are with us in this Chamber. "
"6297",2004,"Mbeki","The work they have done and are doing has placed them at the very forefront of the historic processes that are giving birth to a new society.  "
"6298",2004,"Mbeki","I have no hesitation in saying that they stand tall even among their counterparts elsewhere in the world. "
"6299",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to rely on them to lead the state and parastatal machinery as we break new ground towards the creation of a people-centred society.  "
"6300",2004,"Mbeki","As we enter our Second Decade of Liberation, we must continue to build the sense of national unity, united action and the new patriotism that have manifested themselves in our people's response to the calls - faranani, masakhane, letsema and vuk'uzenzele! "
"6301",2004,"Mbeki","Working together, in conditions of entrenched democracy, respect for human rights, peace and stability, we must continue to produce the Good News that has made our country a place of hope even for other people in the rest of the world.  "
"6302",2004,"Mbeki","We already have the policies and programmes that will enable us to translate all the strategic objectives we have just spoken of into a material factor in achieving the goals of the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, and the continuous extension of the frontiers of the freedom, of which Nelson Mandela spoke a decade ago.  "
"6303",2004,"Mbeki","We have already identified the challenges posed by the Second Economy, which economy constitutes the structural manifestation of poverty, underdevelopment and marginalisation in our country. "
"6304",2004,"Mbeki","We must therefore move vigorously to implement all the programmes on which we have agreed to ensure that we extricate all our people from the social conditions that spell loss of human dignity.  "
"6305",2004,"Mbeki","These include the urban renewal and rural development programmes, the expanded public works programme, the expansion of micro-credit and small enterprises, the provision of adult basic education and modern skills, and the development of the social and economic infrastructure.  "
"6306",2004,"Mbeki","This will also help us enormously to achieve the goals of non-racism, non-sexism, balanced urban-rural development and social cohesion.  "
"6307",2004,"Mbeki","At the same time, we must continue to focus on the growth, development and modernisation of the First Economy, to generate the resources without which it will not be possible to confront the challenges of the Second Economy. "
"6308",2004,"Mbeki","This is going to require further and significant infrastructure investments, skills development, scientific and technological research, development and expansion of the knowledge economy, growth and modernisation of the manufacturing and service sectors, deeper penetration of the global markets by our products, increasing our savings levels, black economic empowerment and the further expansion of small and medium enterprises.  "
"6309",2004,"Mbeki","We will have to focus on the implementation of the measures we have identified to ensure that we achieve better value for the money spent on social delivery. "
"6310",2004,"Mbeki","Among other things, our successes with regard to both the First and Second Economies must create the conditions for us to reduce the numbers of our people dependent on social grants.  "
"6311",2004,"Mbeki","This will increase the resources available for social expenditures focused on investing in our people further to empower them to become better activists for reconstruction and development, away from trapping large numbers within the paradigm of poverty alleviation.  "
"6312",2004,"Mbeki","We will also have to ensure that the institutions and processes we have established and instituted to give effect to the Constitutional and practical requirement for co-operative governance function effectively. "
"6313",2004,"Mbeki","We must also focus especially on raising skills levels within the public sector, and ensure its managerial and technological modernisation, driven by a clear understanding of the developmental tasks of our democratic state.  "
"6314",2004,"Mbeki","We must be impatient with those in the public service who see themselves as pen-pushers and guardians of rubber stamps, thieves intent on self-enrichment, bureaucrats who think they have a right to ignore the vision of Batho Pele, who come to work as late as possible, work as little as possible and knock off as early as possible.  "
"6315",2004,"Mbeki","We have also established institutions and processes to give effect to our shared desire to mobilise all our people voluntarily to act together to achieve the tasks of reconstruction and development. "
"6316",2004,"Mbeki","Quite clearly, the sustained calls for all of us to respond to a new patriotism have struck a chord among all our people, black and white, with the exception of the most selfish and self-centred among us.  "
"6317",2004,"Mbeki","Needless to say, the further translation of the vision of faranani into a powerful motive force for progressive change can only be achieved within the context of the democratic, popular and open participation of all our people, black and white, in determining our shared destiny.  "
"6318",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, I notice that the traditional doomsayers are back at their favourite sport of trying to frighten us with scarecrows. "
"6319",2004,"Mbeki","Seemingly, these have not achieved the maturity of a Rian Malan. "
"6320",2004,"Mbeki","Instead, they are painting monstrous pictures of impending violence during the forthcoming elections and radical constitutional amendments after the elections, by the very people who drafted this constitution.  "
"6321",2004,"Mbeki","The masses of our people sacrificed everything to achieve peace and democracy for all of us. "
"6322",2004,"Mbeki","These masses will not allow that desperate politicians do desperate things to win or retain power for themselves.  "
"6323",2004,"Mbeki","We are all perfectly aware of the tasks of the African Renaissance, or should be. "
"6324",2004,"Mbeki","Together we have worked very hard to ensure that we make the necessary progress with the challenges of the regeneration of our continent. "
"6325",2004,"Mbeki","At the same time, we will still have to contribute as much as we can to the common African effort to strengthen such institutions as SADC, the African Union and NEPAD and help ensure that they discharge their responsibilities effectively. "
"6326",2004,"Mbeki","We must do this work driven by the conviction that we will not allow anything to stand in our way towards the building of a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Africa.  "
"6327",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the officers, men and women of the South African National Defence Force who are doing sterling work to help advance the cause of democracy and peace in various parts of our continent. "
"6328",2004,"Mbeki","The new equipment they are receiving will give them increased capacity to meet this and other obligations.  "
"6329",2004,"Mbeki","Other regions of the world, including the most developed countries, are hard at work to change their neighbourhoods for the better. "
"6330",2004,"Mbeki","We can only ignore or minimise this task with regard to ourselves at our own peril, driven by a lingering sense that we are not an integral part of the African continent. "
"6331",2004,"Mbeki","This we will no do.  "
"6332",2004,"Mbeki","All major current international developments emphasise the importance of constructing a new world order that is more equitable and responsive to the needs of the poor of the world, who constitute the overwhelming majority of humanity.  "
"6333",2004,"Mbeki","The Iraq affair, the continuing and painful conflict involving Israel and Palestine, the WTO failure at Cancun, the seeming paralysis around issues relating to the democratisation of the UN and other multilateral institutions, the dissonance between the process of globalisation and a multilateral system of governance, the issue of global terrorism - all these matters underline the importance of moving forward significantly towards the building of the new world order that has been spoken of, for a long time already.  "
"6334",2004,"Mbeki","We must stand ready to play our part in addressing this urgent challenge, in our own interest.  "
"6335",2004,"Mbeki","During our Second Decade of Liberation, we will ensure that Freedom Park is built and completed, together with other legacy projects that celebrate our humanity, our commitment to the all-round emancipation of all human beings, and human dignity.  "
"6336",2004,"Mbeki","A decade ago, Nelson Mandela said ""The acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate, the government institutions we create, the legislation we adopt, must be whether..."" they help to create a people-centred society, the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, and the continuous extension of the frontiers of freedom.  "
"6337",2004,"Mbeki","As we progress to the celebration of our First Decade of Liberation and Democracy, I trust that the national, provincial and local legislatures will give themselves the opportunity to answer the question whether they have passed this acid test.  "
"6338",2004,"Mbeki","What I will say is that during this First Decade, we have made great progress towards the achievement of the goals we enunciated as we took the first steps as a newborn child. "
"6339",2004,"Mbeki","We also laid a strong foundation to score even greater advances during the exciting and challenging Second Decade ahead of us, as a people united to build a better South Africa and a better world.  "
"6340",2004,"Mbeki","When he contemplated the advent of the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, the Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda, wrote:  ""The era's beginning: are these ruined shacks, these poor schools, these people still in rags and tatters, this cloddish insecurity of my poor families, is all this the day? "
"6341",2004,"Mbeki","The century's beginning, the golden door?""  "
"6342",2004,"Mbeki","(""The Men"").  "
"6343",2004,"Mbeki","We have it within our power to build our own golden door into our Second Decade of Liberation. "
"6344",2004,"Mbeki","We have demonstrated that we have the will to answer the question in the affirmative, and say - yes, this is the day!  "
"6345",2004,"Mbeki","Thank you."

"
"6347",2004,"Mbeki","I am certain that you will discharge your responsibilities in this regard sensitive to the important messages communicated by our people to all of us as we campaigned for their votes.  "
"6348",2004,"Mbeki","I wish you success in your work as you carry out your obligations as our country's law-makers and as you do everything else that our Constitution and legislation require of our national Houses of Parliament.  "
"6349",2004,"Mbeki","I would also like to congratulate you, Madame Speaker and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, as well as your Deputies on your election as our Presiding Officers and similarly wish you success in your important work.  "
"6350",2004,"Mbeki","Our congratulations and best wishes also go to the new Secretary of Parliament, Mr Zingile Dingani, who will soon succeed Mr Sindiso Mfenyana, whom I thank for his many years of service to Parliament. "
"6351",2004,"Mbeki","I am certain that all of us wish him an equally successful future, confident that he will continue to serve our people.  "
"6352",2004,"Mbeki","All of us were very pleased that the April elections were peaceful, free and fair, reinforcing the legitimacy of both our national and provincial legislatures and our national and provincial executives. "
"6353",2004,"Mbeki","This strengthens the mandate of these institutions to discharge their responsibilities as defined by our Constitution.  "
"6354",2004,"Mbeki","In this context, I am privileged to acknowledge the presence in the House of many of our religious leaders, drawn from all the faiths espoused by our people. "
"6355",2004,"Mbeki","I thank these important leaders of our people for their prayers and the critically important role they played to ensure that we had peaceful, free and fair elections.  "
"6356",2004,"Mbeki","It is most fitting that they are with us today, which gives all of us the opportunity to salute them, as well as convey to them our hope that they will continue to bring their considerable influence to bear in favour of the pursuit of the common goal of a better life for all our people.  "
"6357",2004,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker:  When we delivered the State of the Nation Address on February 6 this year, at the start of the final session of our Second Democratic Parliament, we said:  ""In a few months time, we will return to these Chambers to inaugurate our third democratic parliament. "
"6358",2004,"Mbeki","Whoever will be President then will deliver yet another State of the Nation Address.  "
"6359",2004,"Mbeki","""That will provide an opportunity to address the more detailed issues on the government's programme as well as matters that will be covered in the Budget Speech and the Medium Term Revenue and Expenditure perspectives that will support the government's actions as our country begins its Second Decade of Democracy.""  "
"6360",2004,"Mbeki","To summarise what we said a little over three months ago, Madame Speaker, we committed ourselves to:  move our country forward decisively towards the eradication of poverty and underdevelopment in our country, taking care to enhance the process of social cohesion; achieve further and visible advances with regard to the improvement of the quality of life of all our people, affecting many critical areas of social existence, including health, safety and security, moral regeneration, social cohesion, opening the doors of culture and education to all, and sport and recreation; successfully address the important challenges of persisting racial and gender inequalities, the disempowerment of our youth and people with disabilities, and proper care for children and the elderly; focus on the growth, development and modernisation of the First Economy; respond to the challenges posed by the Second Economy, which economy constitutes the structural manifestation of poverty, underdevelopment and marginalisation in our country; ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities to our people as a critical player in the process of the growth, reconstruction and development of our country; focus especially on raising skills levels within the public sector, and ensure its managerial and technological modernisation, driven by a clear understanding of the developmental tasks of our democratic state; strengthen our system of local government; further integrate our system of governance, responding effectively to the requirement for cooperative governance; consolidate the practice of creating public-private partnerships and building government-civil society cooperation; ensure that the system of traditional government plays the role ascribed to it in our Constitution and legislation; build the sense of national unity, united action and the new patriotism; mobilise all our people voluntarily to act together to achieve the tasks of reconstruction and development; respond to the diverse political, economic, social and technological challenges of the process of globalisation; continue to work towards the regeneration of Africa; and, help construct a new world order that is more equitable and responsive to the needs of the poor of the world, who constitute the overwhelming majority of humanity. "
"6361",2004,"Mbeki","At the core of our response to all these challenges is the struggle against poverty and underdevelopment, which rests on three pillars. "
"6362",2004,"Mbeki","These are:  encouraging the growth and development of the First Economy, increasing its possibility to create jobs; implementing our programme to address the challenges of the Second Economy; and, building a social security net to meet the objective of poverty alleviation. "
"6363",2004,"Mbeki","With regard to the First Economy, we will implement the following programme of action:  We will work to raise the rate of investment in the 1st economy.  "
"6364",2004,"Mbeki","To this end, we will engage our social partners to implement the decision taken at the Growth and Development Summit that 5% of the funds held by the institutional investors will be invested in the real economy. "
"6365",2004,"Mbeki","This discussion should be completed before the end of the current calendar year.  "
"6366",2004,"Mbeki","At the beginning of September, we will announce the detailed and enhanced investment plans of the state-owned enterprises, including the financial development institutions.  "
"6367",2004,"Mbeki","At the same time, we will announce plans for the better utilisation of the Isibaya Fund of the PIC, which was established by law.  "
"6368",2004,"Mbeki","We will undertake road shows to present to potential domestic and foreign investors each of the sectors identified within our Microeconomic Reform Strategy, among other things explaining the incentives available to attract investment into these sectors, including the advantages offered by the Industrial Development Zones.  "
"6369",2004,"Mbeki","We will also finalise the Enterprise Development Bill to provide a framework for the development, adjudication and streamlined extension of incentives to all enterprises in a transparent manner.  "
"6370",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to work to reduce the cost of doing business in our country.  "
"6371",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, we will implement the plans we announced in the past concerning our national logistics system organised in Transnet. "
"6372",2004,"Mbeki","Accordingly:  We will seek to work with Parliament to expedite the process of the restructuring of our ports to bring in new investment and lower the costs of moving imports and exports.  "
"6373",2004,"Mbeki","The Coega Industrial Development Zone is already open and the first ship will be able to dock at the new Coega/Ngqura port by September next year.  "
"6374",2004,"Mbeki","Spoornet will increase its freight capacity by 30% over the next five years, while the Rail Commuter Corporation is investing R220 million this financial year to improve commuter transport and safety.  "
"6375",2004,"Mbeki","National Treasury is in the final stages of registering the King Shaka International Airport and freight terminal as a Public-Private Partnership. "
"6376",2004,"Mbeki","Construction will start after agreement has been reached with the Airports Company over land usage in the ongoing negotiations.  "
"6377",2004,"Mbeki","Further, with regard to energy:  The first Regional Electricity Distributors will be ready to operate by June 2005 and the whole process of the establishment of these structures will be completed by January 2007.  "
"6378",2004,"Mbeki","A tender for the provision of new generating capacity to provide for the growing energy needs from 2008, will be issued publicly in December and should be awarded during the first half of 2005.  "
"6379",2004,"Mbeki","The final decisions on the Second National Telecommunications Operator will be taken without undue delay to ensure more development and competition in this sector.  "
"6380",2004,"Mbeki","The government will also lead the process of ensuring that administered prices do not unnecessarily add to the general costs of production and the inflationary pressures in our economy. "
"6381",2004,"Mbeki","Our policies in this regard will be announced by October this year.  "
"6382",2004,"Mbeki","We will pay particular attention to the further growth of the small and medium business sector. "
"6383",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard:  We will carry out a comprehensive review of the regulatory framework that impacts on this sector, to facilitate its further growth and development. "
"6384",2004,"Mbeki","This will be completed by September, and will be followed by such changes as may be necessary.  "
"6385",2004,"Mbeki","We will merge Ntsika and the National Manufacturing Advisory Centres before the end of this year, to create a unified enterprise development agency that will provide non-financial support to small and medium enterprises.  "
"6386",2004,"Mbeki","This year's budget for the unified agency will be R120 million.  "
"6387",2004,"Mbeki","We will work with the financial institutions to implement the provisions in the Financial Charter relevant to the development of small and medium enterprises.  "
"6388",2004,"Mbeki","We will re-establish the Agricultural Credit Scheme (ACS) in the Department of Agriculture to provide capital for this sector, leaving the Land Bank to deal with the established commercial sector. "
"6389",2004,"Mbeki","R1 billion is immediately available to start the ACS.  "
"6390",2004,"Mbeki","We will submit to Parliament a Bill on Cooperatives before the end of the present calendar year.  "
"6391",2004,"Mbeki","We will speed up the process of skills development, focusing on the shortfalls that we have already identified.  "
"6392",2004,"Mbeki","In the period since the holding of the Growth and Development Summit, we have reached the figure of 64 000 with regard to learnerships. "
"6393",2004,"Mbeki","We have already studied our experience in this regard. "
"6394",2004,"Mbeki","Arising from this, we will engage all the Sector Education and Training Authorities, the SETAs, to increase the uptake of learners and improve the focus on the skills that are in short supply. "
"6395",2004,"Mbeki","This process of engagement will be completed by the end of the year.  "
"6396",2004,"Mbeki","We will work to ensure adequate funding of the technical colleges and proper alignment of the courses they offer with the requirements of the economy.  "
"6397",2004,"Mbeki","By the end of the year, we will compile a register of all graduates so as to link them up with Umsobomvu, learnerships, and other schemes and institutions that would help them to start their own businesses or get jobs.  "
"6398",2004,"Mbeki","Within the next three months, the Cabinet will finalise its work on the Immigration Regulations, among other things to ensure that we access such scarce skills from the rest of the world as may be required for our accelerated development.  "
"6399",2004,"Mbeki","We will do more to improve our export performance, focusing on services and manufactured goods.  "
"6400",2004,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we will engage the export sectors to assist them to take full advantage of the possibilities we have to expand access to the EU and the US markets, as a result, respectively, of the SA-EU Trade and Development Agreement and AGOA.  "
"6401",2004,"Mbeki","We will pay the necessary attention to the earliest possible conclusion of trade agreements with Mercosur, EFTA, the US, India and China.  "
"6402",2004,"Mbeki","We will also focus on our further interaction with the African continent, especially within the context of SADC and NEPAD.  "
"6403",2004,"Mbeki","In the coming financial year, we will increase spending on scientific research and development. "
"6404",2004,"Mbeki","This year we will implement the new governance system for the science councils, while we continue to work on the diffusion of new technologies across the economy.  "
"6405",2004,"Mbeki","In this context we must mention that the construction at Sutherland, the Northern Cape, of the largest optical, infrared telescope in the southern hemisphere will be completed in December. "
"6406",2004,"Mbeki","A formal bid has been submitted for us to host the largest radio telescope ever built, the so-called Square Kilometre Array Radio Telescope. "
"6407",2004,"Mbeki","Namibia is host to the most powerful gamma ray (HESS) telescope in the world, which has now been commissioned. "
"6408",2004,"Mbeki","I mention all these to indicate the development of our region as a Global Hub for Astronomy and Space Science and Technology. "
"6409",2004,"Mbeki","This underlines the need for us to devote more resources to the development of science and technology.  "
"6410",2004,"Mbeki","Similarly, we will implement a detailed programme to respond to the challenges of the 2nd economy. "
"6411",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard:  We will ensure that we launch the Expanded Public Works Programme in all provinces by the beginning of September, concentrating on the 21 urban and rural nodes already identified in terms of our Urban Renewal and Integrated and Sustainable Rural Development Programmes. "
"6412",2004,"Mbeki","As we have said before, the EPWP integrates, among others, the objectives of the development of the social and economic infrastructure, human resource development, enterprise development, and poverty alleviation.  "
"6413",2004,"Mbeki","A Financing Protocol relating to the Urban Renewal and Rural Development Programmes will be finalised within two months, to improve the effective and coordinated financing of these Programmes by the three spheres of government and the different departments.  "
"6414",2004,"Mbeki","By the end of the year, the Apex Fund, dedicated to the extension of micro-credit, will be operational.  "
"6415",2004,"Mbeki","The Department of Agriculture will increase its support to agricultural activities in the communal land areas as well as other small-scale agriculture, drawing on resources within the Agriculture Credit Scheme, ensuring the implementation of the Land Reform for Agricultural Development process and the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme. "
"6416",2004,"Mbeki","Once approved, the Communal Land Rights Bill will improve the possibilities for better economic utilisation of communal land. "
"6417",2004,"Mbeki","The Department of Agriculture will, by July, publish its AgriBEE framework for public comment.  "
"6418",2004,"Mbeki","During the current financial year, we will finalise our strategy for the development and extension of financial and non-financial support to cooperative enterprises, as well as submit draft legislation on cooperatives to Parliament.  "
"6419",2004,"Mbeki","The Department of Education will expand the reach of the Adult Basic Education and Training programme, ABET, aligning it with the training objectives of the EPWP.  "
"6420",2004,"Mbeki","Working with the provincial and local governments, the Department of Public Service and Administration will take the necessary action to ensure that Community Development Workers are deployed by the end of this calendar year in the 21 identified urban and rural nodes.  "
"6421",2004,"Mbeki","The Departments of Public Service and Administration, Provincial and Local Government, and Communications will work to ensure that modern information and communication technologies (ICT) are introduced in these development nodes as quickly as possible, to assist in all their developmental and governance efforts.  "
"6422",2004,"Mbeki","Broad based black economic empowerment remains a pivotal element of government policy. "
"6423",2004,"Mbeki","Accordingly:  We will proceed to establish the Black Economic Advisory Council visualised in the black empowerment legislation as a matter of urgency. "
"6424",2004,"Mbeki","One of its first tasks will be to consider the steps we need to take to achieve the speedy and effective implementation of this empowerment legislation. "
"6425",2004,"Mbeki","It will also reflect on the ways and means we must adopt to take advantage of the existing Black Economic Empowerment Charters.  "
"6426",2004,"Mbeki","The National Empowerment Fund will announce new financial and non-financial empowerment products within the next three months. "
"6427",2004,"Mbeki","In this context, we must bear in mind that government has provided R1 billion for black economic empowerment during the current fiscal year, with R10 billion provided for over the next five years.  "
"6428",2004,"Mbeki","As with all our other development programmes, the Black Economic Empowerment process will also focus on the challenge of the empowerment of women, people with disabilities, and the youth.  "
"6429",2004,"Mbeki","As we have already indicated, we will continue to build a social security net to meet the objective of poverty alleviation. "
"6430",2004,"Mbeki","Accordingly:  Again, in improving the quality of life of all our people, work will continue to ensure that social grants reach all the 7,7 million beneficiaries. "
"6431",2004,"Mbeki","The new social security agency will become operational in 2005, improving the integrity and efficiency of the system; We will, within two years, add about 3,2 million children who will be eligible for child support grants as the upper age-limit is raised to children turning 14. "
"6432",2004,"Mbeki","R166 billion will be allocated over three years for social security; We will continue to implement other social security initiatives such as the school nutrition programme and the provision of free basic services. "
"6433",2004,"Mbeki","However, a society in which large sections depend on social welfare cannot sustain its development. "
"6434",2004,"Mbeki","Our comprehensive programme to grow the economy, including the interventions in both the First and Second Economies, improving sustainable livelihoods and create work is meant precisely to ensure that, over time, a smaller proportion of society, in particular the most vulnerable, subsists solely on social grants.  "
"6435",2004,"Mbeki","We also need to achieve further and visible advances with regard to the improvement of the quality of life of all our people. "
"6436",2004,"Mbeki","To achieve this, the following will be done:  We will ensure that within the next five years, all households would have easy access to clean running water; By December this year, through our programmes, we will provide clean and potable water to the 10th million South African since 1994; During the current year more than 300 000 households will be provided with basic sanitation; Through our integrated system of government, with a strengthened local government working with our state enterprise, ESKOM, we will, within the next eight years, ensure that each household has access to electricity; Further, we will continue to do what is necessary to improve the programmes that promote a better health profile of the nation as a whole. "
"6437",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard:  Our programme of ensuring easy access to clean water for all the households within five years would help us in the fight against cholera and other waterborne diseases. "
"6438",2004,"Mbeki","Through our intensified programme against malaria we will reduce malaria cases by 10% each year. "
"6439",2004,"Mbeki","We have already started with the implementation of our Comprehensive Plan on HIV and AIDS. 113 health facilities will be fully operational by March 2005 and 53 000 people will be on treatment by that time. "
"6440",2004,"Mbeki","At the same time, more impetus will be given to the Khomanani social mobilisation campaign as we intensify home-based care. "
"6441",2004,"Mbeki","The regulations on the pricing of medicines are now in effect. "
"6442",2004,"Mbeki","We anticipate that by the end of this year the consumer will pay less for the medicines at the retail outlets. "
"6443",2004,"Mbeki","Clearly, the health programme straddles aspects such as the promotion of healthy life styles, encouraging changes in risky behaviour especially among the youth and reduction of non-communicable causes of death such as diabetes, asthma and hypertension.  "
"6444",2004,"Mbeki","We will build on the experiences of the past ten years to intensify the housing programme. "
"6445",2004,"Mbeki","The following will be done:  A comprehensive programme dealing with human settlement and social infrastructure, including rental-housing stock for the poor will be presented to Cabinet within three months. "
"6446",2004,"Mbeki","In the next three years we will spend R14,2 billion to help our people to have access to basic shelter. "
"6447",2004,"Mbeki","From this financial year we will also address the trend in some provinces where there has been a slow-down in housing delivery as well as addressing the broader question of spatial settlement patterns and implications of this in our efforts to build a non-racial society. "
"6448",2004,"Mbeki","The opening of the doors of learning and culture is critical to the improvement of the quality of life of all our people. "
"6449",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, the following additional measures will be implemented:  We will, during the course of this financial year, recapitalise all the technical colleges and intermediate training institutions, ensuring that they have the necessary infrastructure, capacity and programmes relevant to the needs of our economy; During this calendar year, we will consolidate the merger process of institutions of higher learning ensuring that they do, in reality, become single institutions with a unified institutional culture; By the end of this financial year we shall ensure that there is no learner and student learning under a tree, mud-school or any dangerous conditions that expose learners and teachers to the elements; By the end of the current financial year we expect all schools to have access to clean water and sanitation. "
"6450",2004,"Mbeki","We also have a duty to improve the safety and security of all our citizens and communities. "
"6451",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard:  We will ensure that by 2006 there would be 152 000 officers on active duty in the South African Police Service. "
"6452",2004,"Mbeki","The process of recruitment and skilling of the agencies is already underway; We will, in the current financial year, establish at least two Community Courts in each province, modelled along the Hatfield Community Court in the City of Tshwane, which in the first month of its operation has already finalised 200 cases with a 100% conviction rate; In the next three months we will set up Special Joint Teams to target and focus on serious crime with an immediate objective of apprehending the top 200 criminals in the country, using all legal instruments to bring them to justice; In the next two months Cabinet will finalise the Victims Charter and by the end of this calendar year we will commence with the implementation of the Victim Support Services Programme so as to attend urgently to needs of the victims of crime; From this financial year, the programme to set up specialised courts, including those dealing with commercial crimes and women and child abuse, will be intensified as will the process of transforming the entire judicial system; Combined with these security activities will be enhanced integration between the security and social clusters to deal with the social roots of many of the crimes communities experience, starting off in the nodes identified for rural and urban renewal. "
"6453",2004,"Mbeki","Madam Speaker;  We shall, in the coming months, conduct a thorough review of the impact of socio-economic transformation on social cohesion within communities and across society as a whole, including such qualitative issues as non-racialism and non-sexism, the role and place of family, value systems, identity and moral regeneration. "
"6454",2004,"Mbeki","We hope that this exercise, which will involve structures of civil society, will help us better understand who we are and better appreciate quality of life beyond the material.  "
"6455",2004,"Mbeki","As we said in February, we have to ensure that the public sector discharges its responsibilities to our people as a critical player in the process of the growth, reconstruction and development of our country. "
"6456",2004,"Mbeki","Accordingly:  We expect to pass the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Bill this year to provide the necessary statutory framework for the strengthening of our system of cooperative governance.  "
"6457",2004,"Mbeki","Within the next six months, we will complete the process of ensuring the harmonisation of the municipal Integrated Development Plans, the provincial Growth and Development Strategies and the National Spatial Development Perspective. "
"6458",2004,"Mbeki","Among other things, this will increase the capacity of local government to discharge its responsibilities with regard to the challenge of economic growth and development.  "
"6459",2004,"Mbeki","Local government will invest R38 billion in infrastructure development over the MTEF period, with R16.5 billion of this being transfers from national government. "
"6460",2004,"Mbeki","Total transfers from national to local government during this period will amount to R47.36 billion. "
"6461",2004,"Mbeki","Recognising the critical importance of local government in terms of social and economic delivery, we are undertaking a major review of the local government equitable share allocation and formula, to ensure that municipalities with low fiscal capacity are adequately resourced, and empowered to collect their own revenues. "
"6462",2004,"Mbeki","We will complete this review in six months. "
"6463",2004,"Mbeki","The review will also focus on such systems as need to be introduced to improve municipal capacity for credit control and implementing policies that alleviate the plight of the indigent.  "
"6464",2004,"Mbeki","The national government will immediately initiate discussions with the two other spheres, provincial and local government, to examine the feasibility of introducing at these levels a system of institutionalised cooperation with civil society similar to the national Presidential Working Groups. "
"6465",2004,"Mbeki","We will also assist local government to ensure that the system of Ward Committees functions as visualised in national legislation.  "
"6466",2004,"Mbeki","The national departments will liase with the National Development Agency to improve their cooperation especially with development non-governmental and community based organisations.  "
"6467",2004,"Mbeki","We will ensure the proper functioning of the public sector SETA to address the challenge of building a public service that has the requisite skills and motivation to meet the developmental challenges of our democratic state. "
"6468",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, we have already mentioned the programme to deploy the Community Development Workers.  "
"6469",2004,"Mbeki","Further to improve public access to government services, within two months we will launch the Batho Pele Gateway portal, which will provide streamlined government services on-line, including through public information terminals in Post Offices and Multi-Purpose Community Centres. 60 of these Community Centres will have been built by the end of this year and plans finalised to have at least one of these in each of our 284 municipal areas. "
"6470",2004,"Mbeki","Similarly, we will further refine the imbizo programme of direct interaction between the government and the people, drawing on our experience over the last five years.  "
"6471",2004,"Mbeki","We will work with the relevant provincial governments to expedite the passage of provincial legislation regarding the place and role of the system of traditional government. "
"6472",2004,"Mbeki","This will open the way to allocate resources to this institution to enable it to play its role as defined by the law.  "
"6473",2004,"Mbeki","The government is also in the process of refining our system of Monitoring and Evaluation, to improve the performance of our system of governance and the quality of our outputs, providing an early warning system and a mechanism to respond speedily to problems, as they arise. "
"6474",2004,"Mbeki","Among other things, this will necessitate an improvement of our statistical and information base and enhancing the capacity of the Policy Coordination and Advisory Services unit.  "
"6475",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to focus on making an effective contribution to the challenge of accelerating the process of the renewal of the African continent. "
"6476",2004,"Mbeki","Accordingly:  We will ensure that we contribute as much as we can to the effective functioning of the African Union Peace and Security Council to which we have been elected. "
"6477",2004,"Mbeki","This will include continuing to meet our obligations to the people of the DRC and Burundi and convening the post-conflict reconstruction process in the Sudan, as we have been requested to.  "
"6478",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to make our contribution to the implementation of the NEPAD programme, and, as requested by the AU, also continue to host the NEPAD Secretariat.  "
"6479",2004,"Mbeki","We will immediately begin the process leading to our review next year by the African Peer Review Mechanism.  "
"6480",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to encourage the strengthening of the links between our continent and the rest of the world. "
"6481",2004,"Mbeki","For this reason we will attend the June G8 Summit in the United States, cooperate with Indonesia to convene next year's Afro-Asian Conference, and host the preparatory meeting for this Conference as well as the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban later this year. "
"6482",2004,"Mbeki","We will address the European Parliament in November.  "
"6483",2004,"Mbeki","We have offered to host the Pan African Parliament and await the decision that will be taken by the July Summit Meeting of the African Union in this regard.  "
"6484",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to contribute to the effective functioning of our regional organisation, SADC, helping to enhance its capacity to speed up the process of regional integration.  "
"6485",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to work with our sister countries Zimbabwe and Swaziland so that the citizens of these countries can also enjoy peace, stability and sustainable development.  "
"6486",2004,"Mbeki","We will work to consolidate the system of bilateral cooperation agreements we have entered into with a significant number of African countries, which include Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, the DRC, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Namibia and Lesotho.  "
"6487",2004,"Mbeki","The international situation continues to emphasise the need for us to discharge our continuously increasing responsibility to contribute to the resolution of urgent questions facing the peoples of the world. "
"6488",2004,"Mbeki","In this context:  We will continue to follow the evolution of the situation in the Middle East, necessarily focusing on the Israel-Palestine and Iraq conflicts, contributing what we can to their solution, including support for the vigorous implementation of the Road Map.  "
"6489",2004,"Mbeki","We will persist in the effort to ensure the successful conclusion of the WTO negotiations by the beginning of the coming year, as originally planned. "
"6490",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, we will work with other countries to ensure the effective contribution of the G20 to this outcome.  "
"6491",2004,"Mbeki","We will intensify our preparations to participate in next year's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference.  "
"6492",2004,"Mbeki","We will cooperate closely with India and Brazil to strengthen IBSA, the India-Brazil-South Africa formation, while further strengthening our relations with China.  "
"6493",2004,"Mbeki","We will continue to work with the International Investment Council and the Presidential Council on Information Society further to improve our responses to the process of globalisation and our access to foreign direct investment and modern information and communication technologies.  "
"6494",2004,"Mbeki","We will also continue to work with other countries to speed up the process of the restructuring of the United Nations and other international organisations to respond to the urgent need to strengthen the multilateral system. "
"6495",2004,"Mbeki","This will include making an input into the work of the Panel of Eminent Persons, which was established by the UN Secretary General, and which must present its report before the end of the year.  "
"6496",2004,"Mbeki","I would like to take this opportunity to extend our best wishes to our athletes who will represent us at the Athens Olympics. "
"6497",2004,"Mbeki","They will participate in these Games as our Ambassadors, bringing to the youth and sportspeople of the world the message from this little corner of a great Continent that our people are ready to join hands with the rest of humanity to build the just world whose time is long overdue.  "
"6498",2004,"Mbeki","Exactly a week ago, our delegation presented our case to the President and the Executive Committee of FIFA for us to host the 2010 Soccer World Cup. "
"6499",2004,"Mbeki","The decision of the FIFA Executive Committee announced the following day was celebrated both by our own people and many other Africans throughout our continent and the African Diaspora.  "
"6500",2004,"Mbeki","It is a matter of great importance to us that all the other countries that competed to host the World Cup have communicated their determination to work with us to ensure an excellent 2010 Soccer World Cup. "
"6501",2004,"Mbeki","In this regard, we must also extend our sincere appreciation to Nigeria, which earlier withdrew from the contest, announcing its support for our bid.  "
"6502",2004,"Mbeki","I would like to take this opportunity to express our profound thanks to SAFA, our Bid Committee and Bid Ambassadors, and everybody else who contributed to the success of our bid. "
"6503",2004,"Mbeki","Once more, we demonstrated our ability to gain important victories when we unite to pursue common goals.  "
"6504",2004,"Mbeki","Less than a month ago, the peoples of the world joined us in Pretoria as we celebrated our First Decade of Freedom. "
"6505",2004,"Mbeki","The level and the breadth of the international participation in these celebrations demonstrated that the peoples of the world continue to value our achievements in creating the kind of society defined by our Constitution.  "
"6506",2004,"Mbeki","This was further confirmed by the many other celebrations that took place in various countries throughout the world, including the United Nations and other institutions.  "
"6507",2004,"Mbeki","These two celebrations, of our 10th anniversary and the success of our bid, confirm the strength of the sentiment shared by millions across the globe, for a world of peace, democracy, non-racialism, non-sexism and freedom from poverty. "
"6508",2004,"Mbeki","They speak of a shared dream for international solidarity and friendship among the peoples, and the victory of the African renaissance.  "
"6509",2004,"Mbeki","These circumstances suggest that perhaps the time has come for the emergence of a united movement of the peoples of the world that would come together to work for the creation of a new world order. "
"6510",2004,"Mbeki","This would respond to the urgent need to address the concerns and interests of the billions on our universe who are poor and marginalized, as are the same masses in our country who must be the principal focus of our efforts to build a caring and people-centred society.  "
"6511",2004,"Mbeki","Tomorrow our country will say its last farewells as we lay to rest the remains of a great South African artist, Brenda Fassie, who passed away much earlier than should have been the case. "
"6512",2004,"Mbeki","Perhaps while she was among us, we did not fully appreciate how much her talent served to enrich our lives. "
"6513",2004,"Mbeki","But now we know, too late to do anything to bring her back to give us joy.  "
"6514",2004,"Mbeki","Together, in everything we do, we must respond to her melodic call - Vul' indlela!  "
"6515",2004,"Mbeki","Let us get down to work in a people's contract to build a better South Africa and a better World.  "
"6516",2004,"Mbeki","Thank you."
"6517",2003,"Mbeki"," Madame Speaker of the National Assembly; Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces; Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairperson of the national Houses of Parliament; Deputy President of the Republic; Honourable leaders of our political parties and Honourable Members of Parliament; Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Our esteemed Chief Justice and members of the Judiciary; Heads of our Security Services; Governor of the Reserve Bank; President Mandela and Mrs Graca Machel; Distinguished Premiers of our Provinces; Mayors and leaders in our system of local government; Our honoured traditional leaders; Heads of the state organs supporting our democratic system; Directors-General and other leaders of the public service; Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners; Distinguished guests, friends and comrades; People of South Africa:  Ten years ago in 1993, we began the last mile of the long march against the system of white minority domination. "
"6518",2003,"Mbeki","In that year, we finalised the interim constitution that set the stage for the first democratic elections and our transition to democratic majority rule. "
"6519",2003,"Mbeki","It is also the year in which we lost that indomitable giant of our struggle, Oliver Tambo, and the people's hero, Chris Hani.  "
"6520",2003,"Mbeki","To Sis' Limpho Hani and Mme Adelaide Tambo - who need no introduction in this House - and members of their families with us today, we wish to say that the memory of these heroes will continue to inspire all of us as we enter the Second Decade of Freedom.  "
"6521",2003,"Mbeki","I am also privileged to recognise eight veterans who are with us here today, the first time in their lives that they have visited this seat of democracy, for which they struggled throughout their lives. "
"6522",2003,"Mbeki","These are Mr Marcus Mbetha from the Northern Cape, Mr Johannes Maseko from Mpumalanga, Mr Lesley Monnanyane from the Free State, Mrs Nontsomi Qwati from the Eastern Cape, Mr Marcus Makinta from the North West, Reverend Hamilton Mbatha from KwaZulu-Natal, Mrs Martha Motswenyane from Limpopo and Mrs Magrita Benjamin from the Western Cape. "
"6523",2003,"Mbeki","To them all we say many thanks for everything you did to enable all of us to enjoy the freedoms which many in our country already take for granted.  "
"6524",2003,"Mbeki","As we meet at this place at the southern tip of Africa that houses our national legislature, on the eastern shores of the Atlantic Ocean, the youth of the world is engaged in a sporting contest that will answer the question - who is the cricket champion of the world!  "
"6525",2003,"Mbeki","We salute this city, Cape Town, our legislative capital, that successfully hosted the opening ceremony and first game of the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup. "
"6526",2003,"Mbeki","Today, as before, this great metropolis has provided us with the venue for the commencement of the fifth session of our second democratic parliament.  "
"6527",2003,"Mbeki","On this important day on our national calendar, once more we say welcome to the outstanding sportsmen who have gathered in our country, in Zimbabwe and Kenya, to test one another in a peaceful contest of human skill, ingenuity and endurance. "
"6528",2003,"Mbeki","We extend our best wishes to all of them, and say to all of them - let the best win!  "
"6529",2003,"Mbeki","We thank the International Cricket Council for the opportunity it has given our country and continent to host the Cricket World Cup.  "
"6530",2003,"Mbeki","Once again, we extend our best wishes to our warriors, the Proteas, confident that at the end of the day they will win, because they are the best.  "
"6531",2003,"Mbeki","In the next few months South Africa will launch its bid to host the 2010 Soccer World Cup. "
"6532",2003,"Mbeki","Government wishes to assure our Soccer World Cup Bid Committee of our fullest support as they go into the bidding process. "
"6533",2003,"Mbeki","We are certain of victory this time round, a victory that will be for all Africa.  "
"6534",2003,"Mbeki","On this day when we meet at this place at the southern tip of Africa that houses our national legislature, the eyes of the peoples of the world are also focussed on another place, this time on the western shores of the Atlantic Ocean, the great city of New York, which hosts the parliament of the world, the United Nations Organisation.  "
"6535",2003,"Mbeki","Today, the inspectors charged with the responsibility to ensure that Iraq rids itself of weapons of mass destruction will report to the United Nations Security Council about whether or not they are succeeding in their task.  "
"6536",2003,"Mbeki","Their report may very well decide the question whether the peoples of the world will continue to enjoy a global peace.  "
"6537",2003,"Mbeki","This we must say, that for us as Africans to host the Cricket World Cup, like the President's Golf Cup later this year, communicates the message that we were not wrong when we said that this, the 21st century, will be an African Century.  "
"6538",2003,"Mbeki","However, for us to realise this objective, we require that, unlike the 20th, the 21st century should be a century of African peace. "
"6539",2003,"Mbeki","It should also be a century of world peace.  "
"6540",2003,"Mbeki","Hopefully, today's report of the United Nations weapons inspectors to the United Nations Security Council will not serve as a signal to some that the time has come to unleash the fury of war.  "
"6541",2003,"Mbeki","Today, on the 14th of February, two great world cities, New York and Cape Town, have to grapple with the fundamental human question of war and peace. "
"6542",2003,"Mbeki","They have to choose sides in the contest between human hope and human despair, between war and peace.  "
"6543",2003,"Mbeki","As we speak, a number of our citizens are preparing to travel to Iraq. "
"6544",2003,"Mbeki","These are the experts who led our country's programme to destroy our nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, as well as the missiles for the delivery of these weapons in conditions of combat. "
"6545",2003,"Mbeki","The work they did has now resulted in the South African example of disarmament being recognised internationally as an example of best international practice.  "
"6546",2003,"Mbeki","Recently, we proposed to the Government of Iraq and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, that this team should visit Iraq to share with the government, scientists, engineers, technicians and people of Iraq our experience relevant to the mission of the United Nations and Iraq to eradicate weapons of mass destruction under international supervision.  "
"6547",2003,"Mbeki","I am pleased to inform the Honourable Members that Iraq has accepted our offer, which we have already discussed with the leadership of the weapons inspectors. "
"6548",2003,"Mbeki","We trust that this intervention will help to ensure the necessary proper cooperation between the United Nations inspectors and Iraq, so that the issue of weapons of mass destruction is addressed satisfactorily, without resort to war.  "
"6549",2003,"Mbeki","I would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Government of Iraq for its positive response to our suggestion, as well as the recent decisions it has taken to allow the U2 and other aerial surveillance flights, to encourage its citizens to be interviewed at any location decided by the inspectors without any Iraqi officials present, and to adopt legislation prohibiting the production of weapons of mass destruction.  "
"6550",2003,"Mbeki","To assist with regard to this last matter, we have given Iraq copies of our own legislation dealing with weapons of mass destruction, the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1993, as well as Notices and Regulations published in terms of the Act in the period between 1997 and 2002.  "
"6551",2003,"Mbeki","We have done all this because we prefer peace to war. "
"6552",2003,"Mbeki","We have taken the positions we have, not to oppose or support any country, nor to seek any glory. "
"6553",2003,"Mbeki","We have done what we have because, as South Africans and Africans, we know the pain of war and the immeasurable value of peace. "
"6554",2003,"Mbeki","During the last century, South Africans lost their lives in the titanic battles of the First and Second World Wars and the Korean War.  "
"6555",2003,"Mbeki","Many paid the supreme sacrifice in a protracted contest within our country and a dishonourable confrontation with the peoples of the rest of Africa, especially Southern Africa, as we struggled to end the system of apartheid. "
"6556",2003,"Mbeki","At that time, some among us worked to develop and accumulate exactly the terrible weapons that the Security Council is demanding that Iraq should destroy.  "
"6557",2003,"Mbeki","As we meet here for the first time this year, we trust that this democratically elected forum of the people of South Africa will pronounce itself unequivocally in favour of peace, against war.  "
"6558",2003,"Mbeki","We urge that our national parliament should express itself in favour of the peaceful eradication of any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, for Iraq's respect for the decisions of the United Nations Security Council, for respect by all countries of the principle and practice of multilateralism, for the continuing responsibility of the United Nations with regard to issues of international peace and security, and the peaceful resolution of international conflicts.  "
"6559",2003,"Mbeki","On this day, February 14th, both Cape Town and New York must respond to all these challenges honestly and frankly. "
"6560",2003,"Mbeki","I dare say that this national legislature will choose to give peace a chance.  "
"6561",2003,"Mbeki","I am convinced that this representative body of the masses of our people will do what it can to contribute to the international effort to ensure that our country, our continent and the rest of the world avoid an immensely destructive war.  "
"6562",2003,"Mbeki","We speak in favour of peace because our people prefer peace to war. "
"6563",2003,"Mbeki","They yearn for peace because they know from their experience that without peace there can be no development. "
"6564",2003,"Mbeki","Without development we will not be able to realise the goal of a better life for all. "
"6565",2003,"Mbeki","Without peace we will fail in the effort in which we are engaged, to transform ours into a country of hope, and revert to the past on which we have turned our backs, a past of misery and despair.  "
"6566",2003,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker  With regard both to changing the lives of South Africans for the better, and building relations of human solidarity with peoples of the world, the tide has turned. "
"6567",2003,"Mbeki","Our task is to take this tide at the flood, further to progress towards the achievement of the goals for which so many of our people sacrificed. "
"6568",2003,"Mbeki","This is the perspective that will inform our work as we strive to meet our obligations to our people, and the peoples of Africa and the world.  "
"6569",2003,"Mbeki","Last year when we spoke from this podium, we said our country has a continuing task to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to a better life for all. "
"6570",2003,"Mbeki","The challenge we all face as South Africans is to put our shoulders to the wheel to accelerate the pace of change.  "
"6571",2003,"Mbeki","To address this goal, we called on our people to offer their time and skills to the nation, as letsema volunteers for reconstruction and development. "
"6572",2003,"Mbeki","We also urged the nation to follow the example set by some of our nationals resident in the United States, who had decided to support the development of the country of their birth. "
"6573",2003,"Mbeki","As they engaged this task, they adopted the call - vuk'uzenzele!  "
"6574",2003,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker  I would like to take this opportunity to extend a word of thanks and appreciation to the thousands of our people who rolled up their sleeves to lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all South Africans.  "
"6575",2003,"Mbeki","This includes some of the Honourable Members of Parliament present here today. "
"6576",2003,"Mbeki","Their involvement in practical work to improve the conditions of the people - be it in the campaign to register people for social grants, assistance at police stations, izimbizo, or improvement of learning, teaching and discipline in our schools - emphasises the partnership that should exist between the various arms of government to ensure that life changes for the better, especially among the poor. "
"6577",2003,"Mbeki","It underlines the importance of the contact we must maintain continuously with the people of our country who elected us.  "
"6578",2003,"Mbeki","Of course, our thanks also go to the ordinary citizen letsema volunteers, some of whom participated in the spectacular opening ceremony of the Cricket World Cup, as they had done when we hosted the launch of the African Union and hosted the World Summit for Sustainable Development. "
"6579",2003,"Mbeki","In addition, these ordinary citizen volunteers had participated in all the initiatives undertaken throughout the year.  "
"6580",2003,"Mbeki","As we continue to respond to the challenge to put our shoulders to the wheel to accelerate the pace of change, we reiterate the appeal to all our people to sustain the volunteer letsema campaign and respond to the call - vuk'uzenzele!  "
"6581",2003,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker  Honourable Members will remember that in our address to the House last year, we expressed the confidence of government in the health of our economy. "
"6582",2003,"Mbeki","We asserted then that despite the difficulties that we may experience from time to time and despite the economic downturn across the globe, our economy was robust and had the potential to perform relatively well.  "
"6583",2003,"Mbeki","Indeed, the country has managed to stay the course of growth, with the growth of the Gross Domestic Product for 2002 estimated at 3,1%. "
"6584",2003,"Mbeki","Gross fixed capital formation grew by almost 8% during the year. "
"6585",2003,"Mbeki","We have now had 10 consecutive years of positive growth. "
"6586",2003,"Mbeki","Manufacturing grew by 5,4% in 2002, the fastest growth since 1995. "
"6587",2003,"Mbeki","Our currency has wrested back the losses it suffered during 2001. "
"6588",2003,"Mbeki","During 2002, it recorded its first annual gain against the US dollar in 15 years.  "
"6589",2003,"Mbeki","In the first three quarters of 2002, household consumption expenditure grew by an average of 3,2% while disposable income increased by over 3,5%. "
"6590",2003,"Mbeki","Household debt as a percentage of disposable income is at its lowest level since 1993. "
"6591",2003,"Mbeki","In the third quarter of 2002, gross savings as a percentage of GDP increased above 15% for the first time since 1999.  "
"6592",2003,"Mbeki","Through tax reform, we have since 1999, cumulatively increased the income of citizens by a total of R38,1 billion. "
"6593",2003,"Mbeki","At the same time, the introduction of minimum wages for domestic and farm workers should help improve the income of the most vulnerable workers. "
"6594",2003,"Mbeki","This process will continue in a few other sectors, in consultation with the relevant role-players.  "
"6595",2003,"Mbeki","We also pride ourselves on the contribution that the government has made directly to the income of citizens. "
"6596",2003,"Mbeki","Through two increases in social grants announced in April and October last year, a total of R1,5 billion was made available to the most vulnerable in our society. "
"6597",2003,"Mbeki","This will be augmented by further increases this year. "
"6598",2003,"Mbeki","Over the last decade, including the period when we had to correct the macro-economic imbalances, expenditure on social services grew by 4 per cent per year in real terms.  "
"6599",2003,"Mbeki","Government has put in place various measures to deal with the emergency arising from high food prices. "
"6600",2003,"Mbeki","In addition to medium-term measures that include the setting up of the Food Monitoring Committee, government made R400 million available for food parcels and agricultural starter-packs, as well as other resources for food relief in Southern Africa.  "
"6601",2003,"Mbeki","These direct contributions to the income of citizens, especially the poor, serve to complement the ""social wage"" that has improved with each passing year.  "
"6602",2003,"Mbeki","This ""social wage"" includes the increased number of water and electricity connections, the patent improvements in teaching and learning in our schools, the acceleration of the land restitution and redistribution programme, which includes hundreds of thousands of title deeds in urban areas, primary health care and free housing.  "
"6603",2003,"Mbeki","It complements the efforts of government to contribute to economic growth, to expand and modernise the economic infrastructure and the substantial resources allocated to the development of small, medium and microenterprises.  "
"6604",2003,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker  Over the past few years we have worked hard to lay the basis for the advances we must make to meet the goal of a better life for all. "
"6605",2003,"Mbeki","At the centre of this are the related objectives of the eradication of poverty and the fundamental transformation of our country into one that is non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous.  "
"6606",2003,"Mbeki","We have no doubt that our policies have been and are a correct response to the practical reality we inherited. "
"6607",2003,"Mbeki","The changes taking place in our country attest to this. "
"6608",2003,"Mbeki","The lives of our people are changing for the better. "
"6609",2003,"Mbeki","Gradually we are moving away from the entrenched racial, gender and spatial rigidities of the past. "
"6610",2003,"Mbeki","Our economy is demonstrating a resilience and dynamism that is the envy of many across the world. "
"6611",2003,"Mbeki","Truly, the tide has turned.  "
"6612",2003,"Mbeki","Despite resistance among some, our people are developing a strong sense of a common patriotism. "
"6613",2003,"Mbeki","Our country occupies an honoured place among the nations of the world as part of the global forces working for the progressive transformation of our common universe. "
"6614",2003,"Mbeki","None of this happened of its own. "
"6615",2003,"Mbeki","It is the outcome of the elaboration and implementation of correct policies since 1994.  "
"6616",2003,"Mbeki","Because of all this, let us again affirm that with regard both to changing the lives of South Africans for the better, and building relations of human solidarity with the peoples of the world, the tide has turned. "
"6617",2003,"Mbeki","Our task is to take this tide at the flood, further to progress towards the achievement of the goals for which so many of our people sacrificed.  "
"6618",2003,"Mbeki","This is the perspective that will inform our work as we strive to meet our obligations to our people, and the peoples of Africa and the world. "
"6619",2003,"Mbeki","In this regard, we must pay the closest attention to issues of implementation and as practical an approach as possible to the work we all face as South Africans.  "
"6620",2003,"Mbeki","Building on the foundations we have laid down, we must, once more, set ourselves the necessary realistic tasks for the year. "
"6621",2003,"Mbeki","Needless to say, these must be located within the broad perspective we have just indicated. "
"6622",2003,"Mbeki","These tasks encompass such areas as:  * expanded service provision; * improvements in the efficiency of the public service; * increased social and economic investment; * black economic empowerment; * greater all-round attention to the challenge of human resource development, to help reduce the unemployment levels; * further improvements within the criminal justice system; * further work on the important matter of moral renewal; * expanding our system of relations with the rest of the world; * accelerating the process of the formulation and implementation of the first NEPAD projects; and, * advancing the African Union agenda, including the important issue of peace and security.  "
"6623",2003,"Mbeki","With regard to the foregoing, Madame Speaker, we would like to emphasise that this programme is informed by the experience we continue to gain in implementing practical projects; by the interaction through iimbizo and other means with the people who, more than any consultants, know what their needs are and how these needs can best be met; and by the continuing research that we are conducting to collate and distil the experience of the First Decade of Freedom.  "
"6624",2003,"Mbeki","I wish to assure the thousands of South Africans who attended these izimbizo with Ministers, Premiers, MECs and Councillors that we have listened; we have heard; and we have better understood what the people want.  "
"6625",2003,"Mbeki","For instance, having listened to the people of Bekkersdal during the Presidential Imbizo in Gauteng, national government will work with both the Province and local government to introduce public works programmes in this area. "
"6626",2003,"Mbeki","We shall find safe and secure land for settlement and upgrade community infrastructure both to improve social services and to provide some employment.  "
"6627",2003,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members and the country are aware, we have, for some years, implemented GEAR, among other things to generate the resources for us to address the social needs of our people. "
"6628",2003,"Mbeki","As a result of our successes in this regard, this year will see a further expansion of services to the people.  "
"6629",2003,"Mbeki","This will cover a number of areas including old age and disability pensions, the child support grant which will be extended progressively to cover children up to the age of 14, the school feeding scheme, food and nutrition, education, health, water and electricity. "
"6630",2003,"Mbeki","As we are extending unemployment insurance to workers that have previously been excluded, such as domestic, seasonal and agricultural workers, we urge all employers to ensure that their workers are properly registered. "
"6631",2003,"Mbeki","Our specific objective with regard to all these interventions is to reach as many of the most vulnerable as possible.  "
"6632",2003,"Mbeki","To ensure an integrated approach to this matter of the further expansion of services to the people, this year we will complete our work on a Comprehensive Social Security System as well as the Social Health Insurance Scheme.  "
"6633",2003,"Mbeki","Some of the measures we will take in the context of our expanded service delivery include provision of free health care to persons with disabilities, reaching the 50% of those who are eligible for a supply of free basic water who still have no access to this service, providing poor households, in areas connected to the grid, with up to 50kW of free basic electricity. "
"6634",2003,"Mbeki","In non-grid areas, such households will be provided with a subsidy of up to 80% of the market cost to provide access to electricity systems.  "
"6635",2003,"Mbeki","We will pay similar attention to a comprehensive response to the health challenges facing our country. "
"6636",2003,"Mbeki","This must include responses to the fundamental problem of poverty eradication and better nutrition, lifestyles, observance of legal and social norms with regard to road safety, the social fabric within especially those communities living in poverty, and the culture of observing treatment regimes with regard to such curable diseases as tuberculosis.  "
"6637",2003,"Mbeki","We will continue the work to eradicate malaria in our country and the other SADC countries by 2007. "
"6638",2003,"Mbeki","We will further intensify the efforts to reduce the incidence of the leading killer-disease, TB. "
"6639",2003,"Mbeki","Similarly, we will continue to focus on the treatment of sexually transmitted infections.  "
"6640",2003,"Mbeki","Working together with SANAC, we will continue to implement the government's comprehensive strategy on HIV and AIDS, relating to all elements of this strategy. "
"6641",2003,"Mbeki","This includes implementation of the decisions of the Constitutional Court.  "
"6642",2003,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker  With regard to the accomplishment of the task of ensuring a better life for all, we must make the observation that the government is perfectly conscious of the fact that there are many in our society who are unable to benefit directly from whatever our economy is able to offer. "
"6643",2003,"Mbeki","Obviously, this includes those on pension and the very young.  "
"6644",2003,"Mbeki","But it also includes people who are unskilled and those with low levels of education in general. "
"6645",2003,"Mbeki","This reflects the structural fault in our economy and society as a result of which we have a dual economy and society. "
"6646",2003,"Mbeki","The one is modern and relatively well developed. "
"6647",2003,"Mbeki","The other is characterised by underdevelopment and an entrenched crisis of poverty.  "
"6648",2003,"Mbeki","We have to respond to the needs of the fellow South Africans trapped in the latter society in a focussed and dedicated manner to extricate them from their condition. "
"6649",2003,"Mbeki","The expansion in social provision must reach this sector of our society, to relieve the poverty and suffering afflicting these masses of our people.  "
"6650",2003,"Mbeki","As we will indicate later, other government interventions will also focus on this sector in a particular way. "
"6651",2003,"Mbeki","Critically, some of these interventions must aim at ensuring that as many as possible of those who fall within this category move out of the trap within which they are caught.  "
"6652",2003,"Mbeki","Accordingly, the government must act to ensure that we reduce the number of people dependant on social welfare, increasing the numbers that rely for their livelihood on normal participation in the economy. "
"6653",2003,"Mbeki","This also especially relevant to the accomplishment of the goal of enhancing the dignity of every South African.  "
"6654",2003,"Mbeki","We must also refer to the important matter of gender equality. "
"6655",2003,"Mbeki","Some progress is being made in government to address this issue. "
"6656",2003,"Mbeki","And in the private sector and civil society, the campaign on the rights of women has started at least to form part of the national discourse. "
"6657",2003,"Mbeki","But society still lags far behind in terms of actual implementation, particularly in mainstreaming gender issues on development and poverty-eradication.  "
"6658",2003,"Mbeki","Within government, we will continue to insist on the implementation of the National Framework for Women's Empowerment and Gender Equality. "
"6659",2003,"Mbeki","Concretely, we will soon introduce a system through which gender representation targets and content of programmes become part of the core performance criteria of every government institution and manager.  "
"6660",2003,"Mbeki","The effective delivery of the expanded services to the people requires that we improve the efficiency of the public service. "
"6661",2003,"Mbeki","Without an efficient and effective public service, it will be impossible for us to register the advances that we are capable of. "
"6662",2003,"Mbeki","Again, this will require that we make a number of determined interventions.  "
"6663",2003,"Mbeki","By the middle of this year, the national and provincial governments will complete the process of auditing the public service personnel in these spheres of government and determining their personnel needs in terms of the tasks that confront government. "
"6664",2003,"Mbeki","This will enable us to effect the necessary adjustments to ensure that the public service has the people with the right skills, at the right places, in the right numbers.  "
"6665",2003,"Mbeki","To overcome the problems that we have continued to experience in the distribution of social grants, with an adverse impact on people in need, we shall speed up the process to set up a national social security agency.  "
"6666",2003,"Mbeki","Cognisant of the critical role of local government, the central and provincial governments will work together to extend assistance to this sphere of our system of governance, in particular to improve its managerial, technical and administrative capacity.  "
"6667",2003,"Mbeki","The government will create a public service echelon of multi-skilled community development workers who will maintain direct contact with the people where these masses live. "
"6668",2003,"Mbeki","We are determined to ensure that government goes to the people so that we sharply improve the quality of the outcomes of public expenditures intended to raise the standard of living of our people.  "
"6669",2003,"Mbeki","It is wrong that government should oblige the people to come to the government even in circumstances in which the people do not know what services the government offers and have no means to pay for the transport to reach government offices.  "
"6670",2003,"Mbeki","It will be particularly important that we attract the right people into this cadre of community development workers, train them properly, and supervise them effectively. "
"6671",2003,"Mbeki","These development workers must truly be inspired by the letter and spirit of batho pele! "
"6672",2003,"Mbeki","Among other things, these workers will help to increase the effectiveness of our system of local government, strengthening its awareness of and capacity to respond to the needs of the people at the local level.  "
"6673",2003,"Mbeki","To ensure the proper execution of multi-sector projects, we will appoint dedicated project managers accountable to teams of relevant officials and the Executive, with the authority and responsibility to ensure implementation across departments and spheres of government. "
"6674",2003,"Mbeki","At the same time, monitoring capacity at the level of The Presidency will have to be strengthened. "
"6675",2003,"Mbeki","A framework for this approach will be ready in the next four months.  "
"6676",2003,"Mbeki","The process to set up a government-wide call centre will be speeded up. "
"6677",2003,"Mbeki","In addition, we will start this year to phase in an electronic system, an e-government gateway, in which the directory of government services will be available, according to citizens' needs rather than the silos of the state bureaucracy, an electronic version of the Multi-Purpose Community Centres.  "
"6678",2003,"Mbeki","As Parliament and our people know, for two years we have focused on particular rural and urban nodes in the context of the drive to assist the poorest in our country to achieve development and an improved standard of living. "
"6679",2003,"Mbeki","To improve our work in this regard, steps will be taken to ensure proper coordination, cooperation and operational integration among the three spheres of government.  "
"6680",2003,"Mbeki","We will this year also finalise the proposal for harmonisation of systems, conditions of service and norms between the public service in the national and provincial spheres on the one hand, and the municipalities on the other.  "
"6681",2003,"Mbeki","This year we also have to finalise the long-running debate about the role and place of the institution of traditional leadership, bearing in mind that this is one of our constitutional organs of government. "
"6682",2003,"Mbeki","The necessary national framework legislation will therefore be tabled, which will enable the provincial legislatures to approve legislation specific to each of our provinces.  "
"6683",2003,"Mbeki","In cooperation with the provincial government, a multi-disciplinary national team is working in the Eastern Cape to contribute to the solution of the problems facing this Province. "
"6684",2003,"Mbeki","This work will continue with the necessary speed and intensity. "
"6685",2003,"Mbeki","It will also help the government as a whole to understand what needs to be done to improve our overall system of governance.  "
"6686",2003,"Mbeki","In this regard, we will pay particular attention to five departments, these being finance, education, social development, health and public works. "
"6687",2003,"Mbeki","All these must have the necessary capacity to do their work properly. "
"6688",2003,"Mbeki","They must function in a manner that will enable us to meet our national goals.  "
"6689",2003,"Mbeki","The work being done in the Eastern Cape will also assist us greatly further to intensify our offensive against the cancer of corruption within the public service. "
"6690",2003,"Mbeki","This work will be intensified in all three spheres of government, building on the experience accumulated within departments and through the efforts of such institutions as the Public Protector, the Auditor-General and the Public Service Commission.  "
"6691",2003,"Mbeki","Further improvement in the quality of the lives of our people also requires that we take new measures to increase the volume and quality of our investment in the social infrastructure. "
"6692",2003,"Mbeki","This includes such areas as housing and municipal infrastructure, hospitals and clinics, schools, roads, water, electricity and government facilities. "
"6693",2003,"Mbeki","In all these areas, we must improve our performance relative to the previous year.  "
"6694",2003,"Mbeki","Accordingly, additional resources will be set aside to meet this obligation. "
"6695",2003,"Mbeki","We will ensure that these resources are actually used, consistent with what we have said about the need to ensure that we have the necessary mechanisms to implement our policies and decisions.  "
"6696",2003,"Mbeki","In this regard, we must commend the provinces for significantly improved efficiency in the area of capital investment. "
"6697",2003,"Mbeki","For the period of 9 months of the current fiscal year, expenditure in this area has increased by 48 per cent compared to the same period during the previous fiscal year. "
"6698",2003,"Mbeki","At the same time, it seems clear that not all the allocated funds will be spent by the end of the financial year. "
"6699",2003,"Mbeki","It is precisely this shortcoming that we must address this year.  "
"6700",2003,"Mbeki","With regard to this social investment, we will pay particular but not exclusive attention to the nodal points already identified in the context of our Urban Renewal and Rural Development Programmes. "
"6701",2003,"Mbeki","It is in these areas that we find the largest concentration of the marginalised sections of our population, which require dedicated interventions to extricate them from conditions of underdevelopment and entrenched poverty. "
"6702",2003,"Mbeki","This dictates that we focus on them with regard to our social spending as well as social and economic infrastructure investment.  "
"6703",2003,"Mbeki","To address this investment in social infrastructure, the government has decided that we should launch an expanded public works programme. "
"6704",2003,"Mbeki","This will ensure that we draw significant numbers of the unemployed into productive work, and that these workers gain skills while they work, and thus take an important step to get out of the pool of those who are marginalised.  "
"6705",2003,"Mbeki","We will also further expand the network of the Multi-Purpose Community Centres.  "
"6706",2003,"Mbeki","The government will also make various interventions in the economy in general further to encourage its growth and development. "
"6707",2003,"Mbeki","In this regard, we must mention that it is planned that the Growth and Development Summit that we mentioned last year is now scheduled for the beginning of May.  "
"6708",2003,"Mbeki","Among others, the Summit should address issues of higher rates of investment, job creation, economic restructuring and improved efficiency and productivity, and greater social equity. "
"6709",2003,"Mbeki","All the social partners will have to indicate what they will contribute to the common effort to tackle these various challenges.  "
"6710",2003,"Mbeki","For its part, the government has been working on its own contribution, some of which is indicated in this State of the Nation Address. "
"6711",2003,"Mbeki","We will complete our submission in the near future and make it available to the participants at the Growth and Development Summit. "
"6712",2003,"Mbeki","We urge our social partners to finalise their own inputs so that the next stage of the preparations for the Summit can commence as soon as possible.  "
"6713",2003,"Mbeki","In addition to what we have said, the government's economic programme will focus on:  * continued implementation of our existing micro-economic reform programme; * investment in the economic infrastructure and other measures; * small and medium business development; * micro-credit for productive purposes; * black economic empowerment; and, * job creation.  "
"6714",2003,"Mbeki","The Honourable Members will remember that three years ago, we announced a micro-economic reform programme, which took advantage of the achievements we had made in stabilising our macro-economic environment.  "
"6715",2003,"Mbeki","This included focussed action in specific growth sectors such as agriculture, mining, tourism, cultural industries, information technology, clothing and textiles, vehicle manufacturing and chemicals. "
"6716",2003,"Mbeki","We will now add to this list the aerospace sector, as well as call centres and Back Office Business Processing.  "
"6717",2003,"Mbeki","In addition, specific programmes will be put in place this year to improve assistance to, and expand the pool of exporters. "
"6718",2003,"Mbeki","These include changes to the Export Marketing Assistance Scheme and upgrading our representation in strategic markets abroad. "
"6719",2003,"Mbeki","The successes in the automobile and components sector also point to the work that needs to be done to use a simplified tariff book as an instrument of industrial policy. "
"6720",2003,"Mbeki","Greater focus will also be paid to the service sector, including the expansion of the ICT youth internship programme.  "
"6721",2003,"Mbeki","More than R100 billion has been set aside for capital expenditure in the MTEF period, including, at the national level, R55 billion for infrastructure. "
"6722",2003,"Mbeki","Planned investment by the major state corporations for 2003 is at least R32 billion.  "
"6723",2003,"Mbeki","This investment will include key economic infrastructure projects such as the construction in the coming period of the John Ross Highway to Richards Bay, a dam on the Olifants River in the Limpopo Province to provide water for platinum mining and agriculture, the construction of Ngqura (Coega) port and concessioning of the Durban Container Terminal.  "
"6724",2003,"Mbeki","The improvement of infrastructure at the KwaZulu-Natal coast includes the relocation of Durban International Airport to La Mercy and the establishment of the Dube Trade Port. "
"6725",2003,"Mbeki","Within 8 months details in this regard should be finalised for the private sector to be invited to take part in the project. "
"6726",2003,"Mbeki","Massive investments will be dedicated to upgrading and acquiring railway rolling stock as well as the Taxi Recapitalisation Programme, which, after extensive consultations, should start this year.  "
"6727",2003,"Mbeki","Further work will also be done to improve the infrastructure at our major border posts to facilitate movement of people and goods. "
"6728",2003,"Mbeki","Necessarily, this must be accompanied by the appropriate staffing of these transit points to eliminate inefficiencies that derive from under-trained personnel.  "
"6729",2003,"Mbeki","Further to reduce the cost of doing business in our country, with regard to liquid fuels, the government has decided to replace the In Bond Landed Cost pricing mechanism with what is referred to as the Basic Fuel Price formula.  "
"6730",2003,"Mbeki","This new approach, which we believe will save fuel users more than R1 billion a year, will be phased in, starting in April this year. "
"6731",2003,"Mbeki","We wish to assure the industry that this process will be handled in a manner that does not adversely affect the sustainability of the industry and elements of Black Economic Empowerment already agreed upon.  "
"6732",2003,"Mbeki","With regard to the restructuring of state assets, the Honourable Members know that we will soon proceed with the listing of Telkom. "
"6733",2003,"Mbeki","Work will also go ahead towards the introduction of a second national telecommunications operator. "
"6734",2003,"Mbeki","We have already mentioned the initiatives affecting the transport sector. "
"6735",2003,"Mbeki","Further work will be done relating to electricity.  "
"6736",2003,"Mbeki","The government will also continue to work on public-private partnerships to increase its capacity to respond to the needs of our people. 50 of these are already operational in such areas as health, education, transport, housing, information technology, tourism, and government accommodation.  "
"6737",2003,"Mbeki","The development and support for small and medium business and the cooperative sector remains a priority for government. "
"6738",2003,"Mbeki","Accordingly, more financial and other resources will be committed to the development of this sector of our economy. "
"6739",2003,"Mbeki","This will also see increased support for business chambers and business development organisations, and the expansion of the business mentorship programme.  "
"6740",2003,"Mbeki","Women-owned businesses will receive additional support through the South African Women Entrepreneurs Network (SAWEN), which was launched last year. "
"6741",2003,"Mbeki","Similarly, we will continue to pay attention to the important area of agricultural development.  "
"6742",2003,"Mbeki","We will table legislation amending the Small Business Act, among other things to establish a nationwide advocacy body to act as the voice of this sector and to ensure that support to SMMEs are available at the local level throughout the country.  "
"6743",2003,"Mbeki","With regard to the rural areas, this year we will complete the processing of the Communal Land Bill, not only to ensure certainty in the ownership of assets by families in rural areas, including women, but also to encourage small-scale and co-operative agricultural production and thus improved food security. "
"6744",2003,"Mbeki","As the Bill indicates, this will be done in such a way that communal relations and elements of culture consistent with democracy and human rights are not undermined. "
"6745",2003,"Mbeki","In this context, certainly government has no intention to marginalise the traditional system of government.  "
"6746",2003,"Mbeki","The government recognises the importance of the micro-enterprise sector with regard to the task of poverty alleviation. "
"6747",2003,"Mbeki","We have therefore established an Apex Fund to provide micro-credit to people at the grassroots level. "
"6748",2003,"Mbeki","Discussions with institutions active in this field will be concluded soon so that the funds set aside reach the people in need as soon as possible.  "
"6749",2003,"Mbeki","Despite continuing improvements in the capacity of the economy to create new jobs, the issue of unemployment remains one of our major challenges. "
"6750",2003,"Mbeki","Fundamentally, the solution to this problem is dependant on our achieving the necessary rates of economic growth and development. "
"6751",2003,"Mbeki","Accordingly everything we have said about the economy also relates directly to the issue of job creation.  "
"6752",2003,"Mbeki","In this context we must raise the critically important matter of human resource development. "
"6753",2003,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members know, we launched our Human Resources Development Strategy in June 2001. "
"6754",2003,"Mbeki","This Strategy covers the entire spectrum from Early Childhood Development, primary and secondary education, technical and vocational training, through Adult Basic Education, to skills enhancement through the Sector Education and Training Authorities, on-the-job training in the public works programmes, and specialised institutions such as the projected Advanced Institute for Information and Communication Technology.  "
"6755",2003,"Mbeki","As we have already indicated, by the middle of the year we should have an accurate picture of the skills profile and skills shortages in the public service. "
"6756",2003,"Mbeki","Progress is also being made in identifying such shortages in the private sector. "
"6757",2003,"Mbeki","We are doing this work so that we are able to focus our human resource development strategy correctly.  "
"6758",2003,"Mbeki","Despite the problems they have experienced, the SETAs have already shown what can be achieved. "
"6759",2003,"Mbeki","By the end of last year, over 23 000 learners had or were participating in training programmes ranging from entry level programmes to professional level and post-professional training across the entire spectrum of occupations and sectors.  "
"6760",2003,"Mbeki","To increase access to these programmes by the unemployed, the government will take the lead in bringing more of these into its own training programmes. "
"6761",2003,"Mbeki","We trust that the private sector will also do the same as part of the common contribution to the objectives of the Growth and Development Summit.  "
"6762",2003,"Mbeki","As we have also indicated, we will use the Expanded Public Works Programme to provide on-the-job training to the workers that will carry out this programme. "
"6763",2003,"Mbeki","Again this will concentrate on the section among our working people that is marginalised by virtue of low educational and skills levels.  "
"6764",2003,"Mbeki","We are convinced that sustained and correctly focused work in the area of human resource development, together with the varied economic interventions we have mentioned, will help the country in the effort to attend to the important challenge of unemployment. "
"6765",2003,"Mbeki","In this regard, the government will also present to our social partners a framework for an employment strategy to ensure that we create the best possible conditions for a concerted drive to reduce the levels of unemployment.  "
"6766",2003,"Mbeki","As we approach the end of the first decade of our new democracy the need for an economic transformation that brings about effective and significant black economic empowerment becomes more pressing. "
"6767",2003,"Mbeki","We believe that it is in the interests of all citizens that we succeed in this endeavour. "
"6768",2003,"Mbeki","Through a far-sighted partnership between all sectors of our society we can ensure a stable and growing economy that erases the inequities of the past and draws us all - irrespective of our race, sex or creed - into a more prosperous and equitable future.  "
"6769",2003,"Mbeki","The Government concurs with the view of the Black Economic Empowerment Commission that it is now necessary to make our policies on black economic empowerment more explicit. "
"6770",2003,"Mbeki","In the light of the important developments in industries such as liquid fuels, fishing and mining we need to ensure clarity and certainty for all economic actors.  "
"6771",2003,"Mbeki","The government is firmly of the view that economic growth, development and black economic empowerment are complementary and related processes. "
"6772",2003,"Mbeki","The empowerment we speak of is an inclusive process and not an exclusive one. "
"6773",2003,"Mbeki","No economy can meet its potential if any part of its citizens is not fully integrated into all aspects of that economy. "
"6774",2003,"Mbeki","Equally it follows that an economy that is not growing cannot integrate all its citizens into that economy in a meaningful way.  "
"6775",2003,"Mbeki","The government has prepared a detailed set of proposals on black economic empowerment and the Minister of Trade and Industry and the Department of Trade and Industry, on behalf of government, have consulted extensively. "
"6776",2003,"Mbeki","Today I will set out the basic framework and approach. "
"6777",2003,"Mbeki","On Budget Day the Minister of Finance will deal with the government's positive financial and macroeconomic assessment of the BEE process and shortly thereafter the Minister of Trade and Industry will publish the detailed documents and processes that I will now outline.  "
"6778",2003,"Mbeki","We will introduce into Parliament early this year a basic enabling piece of legislation that will establish broad parameters for the policy and allow for the publication of the strategy document and guidelines dealing with good practice in terms of the policy, all of which will make up the Global Transformation Charter. "
"6779",2003,"Mbeki","This approach has been adopted to allow pragmatism and flexibility within the different components of the economy. "
"6780",2003,"Mbeki","A rigid and inflexible approach is not in the best interests of a modern and globally competitive economy.  "
"6781",2003,"Mbeki","However, by passing such an enabling Act we wish to signal to all that meaningful economic transformation is fundamental to our collective prosperity. "
"6782",2003,"Mbeki","As with all Acts the Bill will be open to comment in the Parliamentary process.  "
"6783",2003,"Mbeki","With the publication of the guidelines shortly we intend to establish certainty and stability. "
"6784",2003,"Mbeki","It is not in the interests of the economy that we have continuously moving goal posts. "
"6785",2003,"Mbeki","However, we also need to ensure that we respond effectively to changing circumstances - as we do with all policy - and to this end we will establish a non-statutory advisory council.  "
"6786",2003,"Mbeki","Empowerment is defined as a broad-based process and the scorecard approach - covering ownership, management, employment equity, skills development, procurement, corporate social responsibility, investment and enterprise formation - developed in the Mining Charter has been adopted.  "
"6787",2003,"Mbeki","The guidelines will provide more precision as to what can be defined as black-owned enterprises. "
"6788",2003,"Mbeki","The actions and outcomes that are within BEE policy will be spelt out. "
"6789",2003,"Mbeki","Government does not seek to encourage charters for every sector of the economy. "
"6790",2003,"Mbeki","This is unrealistic and not necessarily useful. "
"6791",2003,"Mbeki","The basic guideline is that where government disposes of any right, licence or partnership arrangement then BEE components to the arrangement will be clearly spelt out. "
"6792",2003,"Mbeki","This is in line with existing practice. "
"6793",2003,"Mbeki","A charter therefore best serves certain sectors.  "
"6794",2003,"Mbeki","Accordingly government is supportive of the work being done in the financial sector. "
"6795",2003,"Mbeki","If enterprises in a sector feel that they need a charter they should be clear on their objectives and take advice from government. "
"6796",2003,"Mbeki","The guidelines will set out the basic principles that should be contained in any charter and will make it clear that there needs to be consultation at all times so as to involve stakeholders.  "
"6797",2003,"Mbeki","We would stress, however, that all enterprises will be encouraged to utilise the guidelines on empowerment and to develop their own scorecard approach. "
"6798",2003,"Mbeki","Certainly in any dealing of significance with the public sector this will be expected of an enterprise.  "
"6799",2003,"Mbeki","The government will lay greatest stress on black economic empowerment that is associated with growth, development and enterprise development and not merely redistribution of existing wealth. "
"6800",2003,"Mbeki","We will work in partnership with the private sector and will further ensure that government actions are coordinated and monitored.  "
"6801",2003,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker  Over the past three years, our security agencies have been hard at work implementing the National Crime Combating Strategy targeted at priority crimes and policing areas with the highest incidence of serious crimes. "
"6802",2003,"Mbeki","We can say with confidence that definite progress is being made in this regard. "
"6803",2003,"Mbeki","We will continue to improve the capacity of the Police Service to discharge its crime prevention and combating responsibilities in these priority areas.  "
"6804",2003,"Mbeki","Since 1999, the rates of serious crime in targeted areas have either been reduced or stabilised. "
"6805",2003,"Mbeki","Murder has been reduced by almost 17%. "
"6806",2003,"Mbeki","Case backlogs and the number of awaiting trial prisoners have been reduced as a result of the implementation of Saturday courts and improvements in the integrated justice system.  "
"6807",2003,"Mbeki","Crimes against women and children have received priority attention, including the establishment of more Sexual Offences Courts. 11 of these were launched in the past 6 months alone. "
"6808",2003,"Mbeki","Better intelligence capacity has improved the prevention and combating of crimes such as bank robberies, cash-in-transit heists and hijacking of vehicles.  "
"6809",2003,"Mbeki","Before we identify the challenges for the coming year, we take this opportunity to thank all the security agencies for the sterling work that they did during the course of last year in securing both the launch of the African Union and arguably the biggest international conference ever held, the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and now the ICC Cricket World Cup.  "
"6810",2003,"Mbeki","I am pleased to convey to the Ministers and Deputy Ministers responsible as well as the leaders and members of these agencies the congratulations of many leaders across the globe for the excellent work they have done to guarantee the security of important visitors to our country.  "
"6811",2003,"Mbeki","Last year, we were suddenly confronted with terrorist attacks, for which a number of people have now been arrested and charged. "
"6812",2003,"Mbeki","Our security forces will continue to work on this challenge. "
"6813",2003,"Mbeki","At the same time, we will do everything possible to get to the bottom of this matter, being convinced that no normal South African has any reason to resort to force to communicate his or her views.  "
"6814",2003,"Mbeki","The campaign to reduce the number of illegal firearms and other weapons will continue. "
"6815",2003,"Mbeki","A considerable proportion of crimes against the person including murder, the abuse of women and children, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and common assault, take place among the most marginalized sections of our population. "
"6816",2003,"Mbeki","In many instances, these are also connected to alcohol and drug abuse. "
"6817",2003,"Mbeki","It is therefore necessary that we adopt a multi-sector approach to deal with these crimes in the poor and underdeveloped areas of our country.  "
"6818",2003,"Mbeki","Measures will be taken to ensure that the structures meant to support the security agencies, such as the SANDF commandos and police reservists are properly regulated to do what they were set up for. "
"6819",2003,"Mbeki","In this regard, in order to ensure security for all in the rural areas including the farmers, government will start in the near future to phase out SANDF commandos, at the same time as we create in their place, a new system whose composition and ethos accord with the requirements of all rural communities.  "
"6820",2003,"Mbeki","More attention will be paid to stricter border control. "
"6821",2003,"Mbeki","This will require, among other things, improving the capacity of the Department of Home Affairs to carry out its tasks, including the implementation of the new immigration legislation. "
"6822",2003,"Mbeki","Critical posts will be filled, and the automated Home Affairs National Identification System will be launched. "
"6823",2003,"Mbeki","It will also be necessary to upgrade the Population Register, and deal with corruption across the board, including security at Government Printers where identity and other documents are produced.  "
"6824",2003,"Mbeki","The programme to deal with case backlogs will continue, including increasing the number of Saturday and specialised courts. "
"6825",2003,"Mbeki","In this regard, the letsema of legal practitioners from outside of government in this programme is highly appreciated. "
"6826",2003,"Mbeki","We are pleased that this year the Constitutional Court will move into its new and permanent home on Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg. "
"6827",2003,"Mbeki","Further improvement in the physical infrastructure required by our judicial system is also represented by the new Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court, nationally the second biggest after Johannesburg, which we will open officially later this year.  "
"6828",2003,"Mbeki","Taking advantage of the findings of the Jali Commission, we will launch a determined programme to root out the corruption and mismanagement found in sections of our Correctional Service.  "
"6829",2003,"Mbeki","Our success in the sphere of the criminal justice system will also depend on strengthening the partnerships of the letsema campaign, with communities volunteering to assist the security agencies in their work. "
"6830",2003,"Mbeki","Again, in this area, as in all others, conditions are ripe for us to forge a people's contract for a safer and better South Africa.  "
"6831",2003,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker  As Honourable Members are aware, we returned some ten days ago from the Extra-Ordinary Summit of the African Union in Addis Abba, where Africa reasserted the wish of the continent for global peace, security and development. "
"6832",2003,"Mbeki","In this context, it expressed itself in favour of the peaceful resolution of the question of Iraq.  "
"6833",2003,"Mbeki","At this Summit, the AU took specific decisions on proposed amendments to the Constitutive Act of the Union, and steps towards the setting up of the Commission of the AU and the ratification of the Protocols on the Peace and Security Council and the African Parliament.  "
"6834",2003,"Mbeki","This year marks the 40th anniversary of the formation of the Organisation of African Unity. "
"6835",2003,"Mbeki","This Africa Day, 25 May 2003, will be an opportunity for South Africa to host dignitaries from across the continent as we affirm continuity in the objectives of the African continent, and at the same time celebrate the positive changes that the formation of the AU will certainly bring. "
"6836",2003,"Mbeki","I am certain that all our people will celebrate this day with the honour and dignity it deserves.  "
"6837",2003,"Mbeki","A critical part of the positive changes heralded by the formation of the African Union is its programme for development, NEPAD. "
"6838",2003,"Mbeki","Considerable progress was made during the course of last year to cement partnerships within Africa and further afield, so that we can translate NEPAD, without delay, into concrete projects that will impact positively on the lives of the people of the continent. "
"6839",2003,"Mbeki","We are heartened by the fact that Africa's sense of urgency to start implementing this programme is shared by governments, the private sector and civil society on all continents.  "
"6840",2003,"Mbeki","Within weeks, the NEPAD Implementation Committee will finalise criteria, standards, institutions and legal instruments for the Peer Review Mechanism, pending the setting up of relevant institutions within the African Union. "
"6841",2003,"Mbeki","More critically, in various regions of the continent, work continues to identify and start implementing the projects that will give practical meaning to the beginnings of Africa's renewal.  "
"6842",2003,"Mbeki","We take this opportunity to congratulate the people of the Kingdom of Lesotho who last year conducted a peaceful, free and fair election. "
"6843",2003,"Mbeki","We will also continue to work with the people of Zimbabwe as they seek solutions to the problems afflicting their country. "
"6844",2003,"Mbeki","We hope that sooner rather than later, these solutions will be found through dialogue among the leaders of this neighbouring country. "
"6845",2003,"Mbeki","In the Kingdom of Swaziland, we hope that efforts at constitutional reform will soon bear fruit.  "
"6846",2003,"Mbeki","Conditions for peace and development are steadily taking shape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sudan and Angola, and South Africa will always be ready to assist where we can to ensure that the peace, prosperity and national reconciliation that these sister-peoples deserve are achieved. "
"6847",2003,"Mbeki","We remain firm in our hope that the long-delayed issue of Western Sahara will be resolved without further delay.  "
"6848",2003,"Mbeki","The international community also has an urgent responsibility to help resolve the issue of the establishment of an independent State of Palestine, side by side and at peace with the State of Israel.  "
"6849",2003,"Mbeki","In a number of African countries, South Africa's sons and daughters serving in our National Defence Force are working to contribute to peace as a critical condition for development. "
"6850",2003,"Mbeki","We are proud of their efforts, and dip our banners in honour of those who have fallen on duty.  "
"6851",2003,"Mbeki","We will continue this year to strengthen our relations with countries of the South, and improve our multifaceted relations with the developed world. "
"6852",2003,"Mbeki","This will include continued trade negotiations with Mercosur, China, India and the United States.  "
"6853",2003,"Mbeki","Our role in international relations is enhanced by our responsibility to take forward decisions of the Non-aligned Movement and the African Union, which we chair, and to assist the United Nations in realising the commitments of the World Conference Against Racism and the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which we hosted.  "
"6854",2003,"Mbeki","Honourable Members,  In carrying out these our international responsibilities, we proceed from the premise that our success in social change and nation-building is conditional on the progress that humanity makes in building a caring world. "
"6855",2003,"Mbeki","Inversely, building a new and prosperous nation is itself our own humble contribution to the well-being of humanity as a whole.  "
"6856",2003,"Mbeki","In the implementation of our programmes, we need to pay particular attention to culture, music and the arts as manifestations of our self-image as a nation. "
"6857",2003,"Mbeki","This year, we will strengthen the partnerships aimed at identifying and nurturing South African talent, at affording the creativity of our artists free reign, and at giving appropriate promotion of our talents.  "
"6858",2003,"Mbeki","As a contribution to building the self-image that attaches to a proud nation, we shall continue this year with the project to build the first phase of the Freedom Park Monument, following on the introduction of new National Orders last year and others that will be launched this year.  "
"6859",2003,"Mbeki","We are confident that the best of our architects, designers and other creative workers, together with others from the rest of Africa and other parts of the world, will avail their talent for the construction of a Freedom Park that we hope will stand out as an important tribute to the dignity of Africans and all human beings.  "
"6860",2003,"Mbeki","The self-image that we speak of includes the values that should define us both as a nation and as its individual components. "
"6861",2003,"Mbeki","It should also find expression in the people's contract for moral regeneration, as we all strive to become a caring society of up-standing citizens.  "
"6862",2003,"Mbeki","The South African people's contract for a better tomorrow is starting to express itself also in the campaign of citizens, across the diverse identities that define us, to build pride in our country and promote its attributes abroad. "
"6863",2003,"Mbeki","The efforts of the International Marketing Council, Proudly South African and the many individual initiatives in this regard require our support.  "
"6864",2003,"Mbeki","It is in this spirit that we should engage in a national dialogue on how we take forward the report and recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which we hope will be presented to government in the next few months. "
"6865",2003,"Mbeki","This will afford us the opportunity to understand a critical part of our past and join hands in forging a people's contract for a better tomorrow.  "
"6866",2003,"Mbeki","As we enter the last year of the First Decade of Freedom, we will heed the lessons of these first ten years and build on what has been achieved. "
"6867",2003,"Mbeki","Through dispassionate research and systematic planning, and with renewed courage, we must together approach the Second Decade of Freedom (2004 - 2014), as one in which the tide of progress will sweep away the accumulated legacy of poverty and underdevelopment. "
"6868",2003,"Mbeki","It is in this spirit that we shall prepare for a fitting celebration of our ten years of freedom next year.  "
"6869",2003,"Mbeki","I wish our national, provincial and local legislatures success as they discharge their responsibilities to our country and people during this final year of our First Decade of Liberation.  "
"6870",2003,"Mbeki","The tide has turned. "
"6871",2003,"Mbeki","The people's contract for a better tomorrow is taking shape. "
"6872",2003,"Mbeki","I trust that all of us will identify with this historic process. "
"6873",2003,"Mbeki","Given the great possibility we have to move forward, we dare not falter.  "
"6874",2003,"Mbeki","Thank you."
"6875",2002,"Mbeki"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker, Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, Honourable Members of our National Parliament, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Chief Justice of South Africa as well as other members of our judiciary, Heads of the Security Services, Governor of the Reserve Bank, Honourable Premiers and MECs, Traditional leaders, Representatives of Local Government, President Mandela and Mrs Machel, Your Excellencies Ambassadors and High Commissioners, Distinguished guests, Fellow South Africans:  Decision-makers across the globe have accepted the reality that the global struggle to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment is fundamental to the well-being of human society.  "
"6876",2002,"Mbeki","We know this as a matter of fact that the struggle to eradicate that poverty and underdevelopment in our own country is fundamental to the achievement of our own national goal to build a caring and people-centred society.  "
"6877",2002,"Mbeki","Of decisive importance to the millions of our people and the future of our country, as we meet here today, the central question we will have to answer at the end of the day is whether what we are doing as the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, as well as the fourth estate, civil society, is helping to lift from the shoulders of our people, the intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment.  "
"6878",2002,"Mbeki","This fourth opening session of our second democratic parliament, including the debate that will take place next week, must answer this question in a frank, honest and forthright manner.  "
"6879",2002,"Mbeki","What I know and can say without any equivocation is that during the past year, our country has, in real terms, and within its means, moved further forward towards a society free of poverty and underdevelopment. "
"6880",2002,"Mbeki","This I will also say, that we are nowhere near liberating millions of our people from these scourges.  "
"6881",2002,"Mbeki","But I will also say this, that gradually, step by step, we are progressing towards the achievement of the historic goal of the eradication of a centuries-old legacy of colonialism, of racism and apartheid. "
"6882",2002,"Mbeki","This I will also say, that the overwhelming majority of our people consider themselves as actors in the unfolding and measured drama of the eradication of that legacy.  "
"6883",2002,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, our Deputy President, the Honourable Jacob Zuma is not with us today because he had to attend a summit on NEPAD in France, at the invitation of President Jacques Chirac. "
"6884",2002,"Mbeki","At the end of the summit, he will proceed directly to Dakar, Senegal, for another summit with Prime Minister Tony Blair. "
"6885",2002,"Mbeki","Accordingly, Madame Speaker, I am honoured to convey an apology for his unavoidable absence today.  "
"6886",2002,"Mbeki","We wish Madame Speaker also to acknowledge the presence of Mrs Rebecca Kotane on this occasion of her 90th birthday and also Mrs Nontsikelelo Biko, in this year when we commemorate the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Steve Biko.  "
"6887",2002,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, scientists say that anatomically modern humans, people who look like us, evolved in Africa about 150,000 years ago and then slowly spread out to occupy most of the globe. "
"6888",2002,"Mbeki","They say that a key question has been when and where did these people first become modern in their behaviour. "
"6889",2002,"Mbeki","Until now, archaeological evidence has pointed to Europe as the centre for this development about 35,000 years ago. "
"6890",2002,"Mbeki","The markers for modern behaviour include the production of art, bone tools and a capacity for symbolism. "
"6891",2002,"Mbeki","Lack of evidence of these behaviours suggested that people in Africa lagged behind those in Europe.  "
"6892",2002,"Mbeki","Remarkable new finds by South African archaeologists at Blombos Cave in the southern Cape indicate that the prehistory of Africa and its people now needs rewriting. "
"6893",2002,"Mbeki","Blombos Cave has produced evidence that African people were producing exquisite bone tools and delicately-made stone spear points more than 70,000 years ago. "
"6894",2002,"Mbeki","But the most spectacular find is a slab of ochre engraved with abstract designs 77,000 years ago.  "
"6895",2002,"Mbeki","Described by the South African Museum as ""the world's oldest art object"", this invaluable slab of ochre is on display in this case here next to this podium, an example of the extraordinary heritage of the evolution of humanity that resides within our country and which we must preserve. "
"6896",2002,"Mbeki","The designs on the slab were made deliberately and with symbolic intent. "
"6897",2002,"Mbeki","The scientists say that it is now to Africa that we look for the origins of the human imagination and human ingenuity and for the genesis of art.  "
"6898",2002,"Mbeki","We thank the South African Museum for lending us this exhibit for a few hours as well as the presiding officers for agreeing that it should be brought into the chamber.  "
"6899",2002,"Mbeki","I am especially pleased to welcome to our parliament Prof Chris Henshilwood, who led a team of scientists that found the Blombos engraving. "
"6900",2002,"Mbeki","All of us are committed to do everything we can to support our scientists who are working selflessly to unravel the mysteries of the evolution of humanity.  "
"6901",2002,"Mbeki","We also look forward to parliament's own Millennium Project which aims to collect, collate and interpret our diverse heritage so that we may build a common identity and nationhood.  "
"6902",2002,"Mbeki","We meet here at the beginning of a year during which our country will host two important summit meetings that are of great significance to Africa and the world. "
"6903",2002,"Mbeki","These are the founding Summit Meeting of the African Union in July and the World Summit for Sustainable Development in August-September.  "
"6904",2002,"Mbeki","In addition to launching the African Union (AU), the first of these Summits will, among other things, take important decisions about the critical issues of peace and stability on our continent, good political governance and good economic governance. "
"6905",2002,"Mbeki","It will also have the possibility to consider specific and implementable NEPAD development programmes, whose central objective is the elimination of poverty and underdevelopment on our continent.  "
"6906",2002,"Mbeki","The Johannesburg World Summit for Sustainable Development, the largest high-level international gathering this year, will also focus on the critical matter of development and the eradication of poverty. "
"6907",2002,"Mbeki","This is of fundamental interest to our country, our continent and the rest of the developing world.  "
"6908",2002,"Mbeki","It will build on what was agreed at the historic United Nations Millennium Summit of the year 2000 and the Monterrey, Mexico, conference next month, which will discuss Financing for Development.  "
"6909",2002,"Mbeki","The nations of the world elected to come to our country because they understand and appreciate what we have done in the last seven-and-a-half years to address within our own borders precisely the same questions that constitute the global agenda. "
"6910",2002,"Mbeki","They chose to convene in South Africa because they are convinced that we have something of value to contribute to the building of a new and more equitable world order that must surely emerge.  "
"6911",2002,"Mbeki","The recognition by the peoples of the world of the fact that we have established ourselves as a winning nation, as a people determined to succeed, places an obligation on us in fact to succeed.  "
"6912",2002,"Mbeki","Today, millions of our people ask themselves the question - how can I lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all!  "
"6913",2002,"Mbeki","During our recent visit to New York to participate in the proceedings of the World Economic Forum, we had the privilege to meet South Africans who live in or have become citizens of the United States. "
"6914",2002,"Mbeki","These are Marco Piovesan, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, and Cathy Gorille, who lives in Seattle, Washington.  "
"6915",2002,"Mbeki","They and their friends, all born in South Africa, have also been asking themselves the question - how can we, who reside in the United States, lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all South Africans!  "
"6916",2002,"Mbeki","From across the Atlantic, they have decided to make their own contribution to the common national effort by concentrating their resources and expertise in a programme for the reconstruction and development of our country. "
"6917",2002,"Mbeki","Correctly and interestingly, they have entitled their programme - Vuk� uzenzele! - which idiomatically might be expressed as Arise and Act!  "
"6918",2002,"Mbeki","The call they have made applies to each one of us as we review a year in which we called for unity in action among all South Africans for change. "
"6919",2002,"Mbeki","It is an abiding challenge as we set out the programme of government for the coming period.  "
"6920",2002,"Mbeki","On the occasion of our address to the joint sitting of our two Houses of Parliament last year, we set out a programme of action focused on taking us further forward on the road towards a better life for all our people.  "
"6921",2002,"Mbeki","The programme, as further elaborated by Ministers in their addresses to Parliament and their public briefings, was concrete. "
"6922",2002,"Mbeki","Where possible, we indicated the time frames within which particular actions would be undertaken. "
"6923",2002,"Mbeki","And so the time has come to account.  "
"6924",2002,"Mbeki","A few weeks ago, we received an unsolicited report from a team of academics at the University of Stellenbosch, led by Professor Willie Esterhuyse, which comments on our government's performance during the course of the year 2001. "
"6925",2002,"Mbeki","Having studied the programme government set itself at the beginning of the year, the team undertook a systematic analysis of what had been done to implement this programme.  "
"6926",2002,"Mbeki","This is what the team says:  ""The President made 43 'promises' in his speech. "
"6927",2002,"Mbeki","By 8 January 2002 - eleven months after the speech was made - 65% of these have either been achieved or are credibly in progress. 16% have not been achieved. "
"6928",2002,"Mbeki","That gives a ratio of 4 items of progress versus one item not yet completed.  "
"6929",2002,"Mbeki","""On a further 19% we do not have sufficient information to make a call...  ""65% vs. 16% is in our opinion a very good performance. "
"6930",2002,"Mbeki","Governance is not about pushing buttons and things happening instantaneously. "
"6931",2002,"Mbeki","Various obstacles like inertia, vested interests, competing agendas, lack of capacity and the like must be overcome.  "
"6932",2002,"Mbeki","""From various speeches and press releases it is clear that Ministers are working towards the goals set by the President. "
"6933",2002,"Mbeki","Looked at closely, there is coherence and a sense of purpose and integration.  "
"6934",2002,"Mbeki","""Some of the 16% of items not yet achieved are those with a very large impact on the economy and society like the Telkom IPO, clarity on telecommunication issues and an effective campaign against AIDS. "
"6935",2002,"Mbeki","We have taken a hard line and suggested that these have not been achieved, although government can certainly argue that they are in progress.""  "
"6936",2002,"Mbeki","The team then explains why in its opinion things do not ""look and feel better"", as they put it, despite the progress that has been achieved.  "
"6937",2002,"Mbeki","In its view, firstly this is because ""communication by government is not always optimum"". "
"6938",2002,"Mbeki","Secondly, it is because despite ""a lot of good progress"" on ""macro issues that are vitally important"", these are ""far removed from the [person] in the street"". "
"6939",2002,"Mbeki","""We should also submit that, looking back at 2001, the very solid progress recorded has been overshadowed by developments in Zimbabwe and around HIV/AIDS"".  "
"6940",2002,"Mbeki","As government, and even as Members of Parliament, we may not agree with some or other part of these comments. "
"6941",2002,"Mbeki","But there is no gainsaying the fact that the analysis provides a fair assessment of government's work in the past year.  "
"6942",2002,"Mbeki","And as the team says, the national successes are cause for celebration. "
"6943",2002,"Mbeki","Overall, we should all be proud that steadily, our country is moving away from the past of racism, poverty, conflict and economic stagnation.  "
"6944",2002,"Mbeki","The weaknesses pointed out by the Stellenbosch researchers reflect a variety of limitations in the structures and systems of government that should be put right. "
"6945",2002,"Mbeki","We can proffer a host of cogent reasons for these and other shortcomings. "
"6946",2002,"Mbeki","But, to the extent that we have the capacity to do something about the problems, we should and do take responsibility as government.  "
"6947",2002,"Mbeki","I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and thanks to Professor Esterhyuse and the team for an informative, honest, frank and dispassionate assessment of the work of government. "
"6948",2002,"Mbeki","Besides putting the resources of the University at the disposal of the nation's current endeavours, there is an important moral to this initiative. "
"6949",2002,"Mbeki","Without being asked by anybody in government, in a very practical manner, the Stellenbosch team answered the question - how can I lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life for all!  "
"6950",2002,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, Chairperson, the past year has brought to the fore many patriotic South Africans who have found a practical answer to this question.  "
"6951",2002,"Mbeki","These include the school principal at Sandi Secondary School near Umtata, Bongi Peyana, who put in an extra effort to raise a derelict institution towards the highest summits of success in teaching and learning.  "
"6952",2002,"Mbeki","They include Ivan Booth, a young South African who, after numerous debates with his peers about the opportunities that democratic South Africa offers to all its people, decided to draft a manuscript for a publication entitled, ""South Africa: Reasons to Stay"". "
"6953",2002,"Mbeki","Ivan says the book is dedicated:  ""...to the nation that won its place in history ...he nation with the brightest future ...the nation that fights and wins ...the nation that doesn't know how great it is"".  "
"6954",2002,"Mbeki","In a postscript to his foreword, this young and proud South African reports:  ""Several people have mentioned that anyone publishing such a book is effectively pushing themselves into a corner, should they ever wish to leave South Africa. "
"6955",2002,"Mbeki","Hell, yes. "
"6956",2002,"Mbeki","But what a corner...!"" "
"6957",2002,"Mbeki","I trust the presiding officers will excuse the language.  "
"6958",2002,"Mbeki","These heroes who are lending a hand to make South Africa succeed include the children of the Inkonjane Senior Phase School in Soweto who, in partnership with the Sunday Times, volunteered their time and meagre resources to help fellow children in rural Ingwavuma, KwaZulu-Natal affected by AIDS and ill-health.  "
"6959",2002,"Mbeki","They include the people of Rockville, Soweto, who during the course of last year strengthened their co-operation with the Police Service, and have, as a result reduced crime in their area by half in 2001.  "
"6960",2002,"Mbeki","These and many other South Africans are the true leaders and heroes and heroines of the nation - the volunteers whose selfless dedication will ensure that we make progress to make ours truly a nation of hope.  "
"6961",2002,"Mbeki","We have it within us as a nation to join them and many others to forge a massive movement of volunteers - dedicated workers in all fields of life - and bring to life those enduring attributes of all our people, of perseverance and persistence in the struggle for our own good and the good of humanity.  "
"6962",2002,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, Chairperson, the assessment of the Stellenbosch team that we referred to earlier is that we are making progress as a nation in addressing the social backlogs that we inherited from the past. "
"6963",2002,"Mbeki","Let us examine, from data available in government, what the trends are in this regard.  "
"6964",2002,"Mbeki","In the five calendar years leading to the end of 1998, three million South Africans had been provided with access to clean running water through the community water supply project. "
"6965",2002,"Mbeki","In only three years since 1999, four million more have been connected, bringing the total to seven million.  "
"6966",2002,"Mbeki","In the five calendar years to the end of 1998, 2,3 million electricity grid-connections had been made. "
"6967",2002,"Mbeki","In the three years since 1999, 1,2 million new connections had been made, bringing the total to 3,48 million.  444 000 hectares had been redistributed in the land reform programme in the five years to the end of 1998; in the three years since then, the number has increased by 600 000 hectares, bringing the total to over one million hectares. "
"6968",2002,"Mbeki","The pace has dramatically increased in the case of land restitution, with 48 claims settled at the end of 1998; while by the end of 2001 the total number of settlements has increased to 29 000.  "
"6969",2002,"Mbeki","While the number of houses built or under construction was 514 000 at the end of the financial year in 1998, the number currently stands at 1,2 million.  "
"6970",2002,"Mbeki","These figures speak to the progress we are making in providing basic services to the majority of South Africans.  "
"6971",2002,"Mbeki","They add to the qualitative improvements in learning and teaching in our schools and the dramatic improvements in Matric results, which show that the transformation process is starting to bear fruit.  "
"6972",2002,"Mbeki","The masses of our people, both black and white, both resident at home and abroad, are, like the peoples of the world, driven by hope and confidence in our future as a country.  "
"6973",2002,"Mbeki","They are determined to see our country progress, refusing to demobilise themselves by succumbing to carefully cultivated pessimism and despair. "
"6974",2002,"Mbeki","As a government elected by the overwhelming majority of our people, we have an obligation to respond to and sustain this hope and confidence in a rational, realistic and a practical manner.  "
"6975",2002,"Mbeki","As it must do, the Government has conducted its own thorough assessment of its own performance as well as the state of the nation. "
"6976",2002,"Mbeki","We have also studied carefully the findings and comments made by the academics from Stellenbosch.  "
"6977",2002,"Mbeki","We have also recalled our constitutional and legal obligations. "
"6978",2002,"Mbeki","We have also taken into account what the Stellenbosch academics said, that 'governance is not about pushing buttons and things happening instantaneously'.  "
"6979",2002,"Mbeki","The programme we will pursue this year builds on the foundations that have already been laid. "
"6980",2002,"Mbeki","It is informed by the broad objectives our country agreed upon in the context of the goal of reconstruction and development, at the centre of which is the eradication of the legacy of poverty and underdevelopment.  "
"6981",2002,"Mbeki","This year, the Government will work further to reduce the level of poverty in our society. "
"6982",2002,"Mbeki","This will be expressed in concrete, time-specific programmes.  "
"6983",2002,"Mbeki","This year, the Government will work further to develop our greatest resource, our people, including the working people, the women, the youth and the disabled. "
"6984",2002,"Mbeki","Particular attention will be paid to such matters as health, including AIDS, education and training and the National Youth Service.  "
"6985",2002,"Mbeki","This year, the Government will initiate additional programmes to improve the quality of life of all our people, encompassing such issues as safety and security and moral renewal.  "
"6986",2002,"Mbeki","This year, the Government will further intensify its attention on questions of social equity. "
"6987",2002,"Mbeki","This will include matters of black economic empowerment, women's emancipation, and justice for the disabled.  "
"6988",2002,"Mbeki","And this year, the Government will further increase its focus on the issue of achieving higher rates of economic growth and development. "
"6989",2002,"Mbeki","This will include promotion of domestic and foreign investment, trade promotion, a social accord and the convening of a growth summit.  "
"6990",2002,"Mbeki","This year, building on the agreement we have reached with the public sector unions, the Government will work further to improve the efficiency of government. "
"6991",2002,"Mbeki","We will pay particular attention to such questions as improving professional competence at all levels of government radically to change the quality of service delivery.  "
"6992",2002,"Mbeki","This year, the Government will take additional steps further to strengthen and entrench our system of democratic governance. "
"6993",2002,"Mbeki","This will include the appropriate celebration of the 5th anniversary of our Constitution and the resolution of the various questions relating to cultural, language, and religious rights, as well as the issue of the place and role of our traditional system of government.  "
"6994",2002,"Mbeki","This year, the Government will work to discharge its current international responsibilities. "
"6995",2002,"Mbeki","This will include the hosting of the Summit Conferences to which we have referred to and other tasks that relate to specific instances, including the situation in the Middle East, as well as the fight against terrorism.  "
"6996",2002,"Mbeki","Finally, this year, the Government will work further to strengthen its links with the masses of our people. "
"6997",2002,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we will participate in, encourage and promote the involvement of as many of our people as possible in the people's campaign Vuk� uzenzele! "
"6998",2002,"Mbeki","In this context, we will strive to give real meaning to the strategic challenge facing the Public Service - Batho Pele!  "
"6999",2002,"Mbeki","In pushing back the frontiers of poverty, we shall do this in partnership with many in our society who are ready to lend a hand in the national effort to build a better life.  "
"7000",2002,"Mbeki","Let us cite some of the tasks in this regard. "
"7001",2002,"Mbeki","We need massive mobilisation around registration for social grants.  "
"7002",2002,"Mbeki","Government paid out 3,3 million grants in November 2000, and the number increased to 3,8 million by November 2001, the greatest increase being in child grants. "
"7003",2002,"Mbeki","In its programme for the medium-term, government had targeted the registration of three million children eligible for a grant by 2005. "
"7004",2002,"Mbeki","As a result of better awareness and improved efforts by the Public Service, we are on course to meet this target by the year 2003.  "
"7005",2002,"Mbeki","Government will in the next few weeks approach religious bodies, trade unions, traditional leaders, youth structures, civic associations, women's organisations and others, for all of us to lend a hand so that in the next three years, we register all who are eligible for the child grant and other social allowances.  "
"7006",2002,"Mbeki","With each one of us lending a hand, we can attain this, and further ensure that we not only improve the integrity of the system against corruption, but also that new registrations are conducted in reasonable time.  "
"7007",2002,"Mbeki","I would like to add that, as the Minister of Finance will elaborate in the Budget Speech, we shall this year increase allocations to both old age pensions and child grants by far more than the rate of inflation.  "
"7008",2002,"Mbeki","This call for a national partnership in support of the beneficiaries of social grants, and the increases we have referred to, underline the commitment of this government to improving the conditions of the most vulnerable sectors of our population. "
"7009",2002,"Mbeki","The plight of the poor is at the top of our agenda.  "
"7010",2002,"Mbeki","Again, as part of our work to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to a better life, possibilities have been created for further tax cuts particularly for the lower end of the salary scale, a critical contribution by government to higher real wages for our workers.  "
"7011",2002,"Mbeki","Preserving and developing our human resources is a matter that all of us should pay particular attention to, both individually and collectively.  "
"7012",2002,"Mbeki","Government has implemented the Human Resource Development Programme conscious of the fact that it is the surest guarantee to sustainable employment and economic growth. "
"7013",2002,"Mbeki","Tens of thousands of trainees have benefited from this, ranging from science and mathematics teachers, agricultural inspectors, information and communications technology learnerships to retrenched mine-workers and so on. "
"7014",2002,"Mbeki","This work will be intensified during the course of this year.  "
"7015",2002,"Mbeki","Studies that we have conducted in our interaction with the Presidential ICT Councils, whose establishment we announced last year, have shown that a critical and pervasive element in economic development in the current age is the optimum utilisation of information and communications technology. "
"7016",2002,"Mbeki","In addition to the many programmes we have introduced in this area, including tele-centres, we shall as a matter of urgency complete the work towards the establishment of an ICT University. "
"7017",2002,"Mbeki","Microsoft informed me last week that it would donate all the software needed in the 32 000 public schools.  "
"7018",2002,"Mbeki","The implementation of the National Plan for Higher Education will gain momentum in the coming months; and government is under no illusion that the process will be easy. "
"7019",2002,"Mbeki","We are confident though that, working in partnership with higher education institutions, we shall fashion a system that will ensure that we meet the challenges of the modern world.  "
"7020",2002,"Mbeki","Again, in the spirit of Vuk� uzenzele, we must arise and act in partnership across the nation and ensure proper teaching and learning in our schools.  "
"7021",2002,"Mbeki","Government will in the current medium-term expenditure period allocate the necessary resources to ensure that no child studies under a tree. "
"7022",2002,"Mbeki","Consultations will be held with provincial administrations to ensure that this programme is put in place as a matter of urgency. "
"7023",2002,"Mbeki","Further, through the Community-based Public Works Programmes, it should be possible to allocate resources for massive restoration projects in our schools, clinics, hospitals and other amenities across the country. "
"7024",2002,"Mbeki","The Gauteng Province informs us that R500 million over three years has been allocated for this purpose already.  "
"7025",2002,"Mbeki","As we push back the frontiers of poverty, the Integrated Rural Development and Urban Renewal Programmes assume critical importance. "
"7026",2002,"Mbeki","Work has started in all the 13 rural nodes identified last year, with integrated programmes ranging from community production centres, Multi-purpose Community Centres, social infrastructure projects and others being laid out. "
"7027",2002,"Mbeki","In the urban nodes, business plans have been finalised and a number of projects are already being implemented.  "
"7028",2002,"Mbeki","Particularly in rural areas, emphasis will be laid on ensuring food security and community-based job-creation projects, so as directly to address the state of poverty in which communities live.  "
"7029",2002,"Mbeki","Consolidating this integrated work in the nodes already identified will be the focus of government's work this year. "
"7030",2002,"Mbeki","This will then lay the basis for the extension of the nodes to other parts of the country in the near future.  "
"7031",2002,"Mbeki","We intend, within the next three years, to complete the land restitution process, which is a critical part of our land reform programme.  "
"7032",2002,"Mbeki","In each Province of the country, intense water and sanitation programmes are being implemented to improve hygiene, with emphasis on schools and cholera-affected localities in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. "
"7033",2002,"Mbeki","Though we have contained the worst impact of this disease in these areas, we operate from the premise that the long-term solution is quality services to all.  "
"7034",2002,"Mbeki","Government, working in partnership with all sectors, particularly the SA National AIDS Council (SANAC), will intensify its comprehensive programme against AIDS, sexually-transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases.  "
"7035",2002,"Mbeki","In implementing the agreement we reached with the pharmaceutical companies, we have initiated discussions with some of them to examine new ways of making drugs more affordable and to strengthen our health infrastructure. "
"7036",2002,"Mbeki","They are responding positively indeed.  "
"7037",2002,"Mbeki","The work that is being done by various institutions within or related to government on the health profile of the nation - the burden of disease, regional and local trends, mortality statistics and so on - is critical in fashioning a comprehensive response both in the public and private sectors. "
"7038",2002,"Mbeki","In addition to the many campaigns to change our lifestyles for healthier living, the focus of our programmes in the coming period will be the improvement in quality of services in public health system.  "
"7039",2002,"Mbeki","With regard to AIDS in particular, our focus remains: a massive prevention campaign directed at ensuring that the high rates of awareness translate into a change of lifestyles; care for the affected and infected; treatment of all diseases including those associated with AIDS; and research into a vaccine. "
"7040",2002,"Mbeki","This programme has been described by the head of UNAIDS, Dr Peter Piot, as the largest and most comprehensive in Africa and one of the largest in the world; a programme, he says, with very high levels of government investment, which is starting to show results.  "
"7041",2002,"Mbeki","Proceeding from the accepted premise that there is no cure to AIDS, we are convinced that, besides the individual and collective responsibility for us to take care of our own lives, protection and enhancement of the immune system is a critical intervention in both the prevention and management of AIDS. "
"7042",2002,"Mbeki","By implication, therefore, poverty reduction and appropriate nutrition constitute an important front in this campaign.  "
"7043",2002,"Mbeki","At the same time, continuing work will be done to monitor the efficacy of anti-retroviral interventions against mother-to-child transmission in the sites already operational and any new ones that may be decided upon.  "
"7044",2002,"Mbeki","Our partnership across society should advance these multiple interventions required for us to deal with this epidemic. "
"7045",2002,"Mbeki","Any focus on one issue, at the expense of the others, may have the effect of undermining what we all seek to achieve.  "
"7046",2002,"Mbeki","Honourable Members, last December, the South African Police Service released comprehensive statistics on the incidence of crime in our society and the trends that attach to the rates of various forms of crime.  "
"7047",2002,"Mbeki","It is our hope that Honourable Members and the whole of our society, including the media, will continue to apply their minds to the issues raised in that briefing, the better to appreciate the role that society as a whole needs to play in dealing with this scourge. "
"7048",2002,"Mbeki","Indeed, when impassioned calls were made for the release of statistics, we believe the aim was not to ""check"" whether government is ""delivering"" as it is said, but to ensure that all of us lend a hand in the effort to combat and prevent crime.  "
"7049",2002,"Mbeki","The simple fact that most of the crimes of assault and murder happen between Friday and Sunday, among people who know one another, and with many of them under the influence of alcohol or drugs speaks to the critical importance of community organisation and systems of social censure.  "
"7050",2002,"Mbeki","Clearly, many of these crimes, as well as those related to rape, domestic violence and child abuse cannot be policed with any measure of success by the security agencies acting alone.  "
"7051",2002,"Mbeki","Credit is due to the thousands of South Africans who have joined the Community Police Forums and our Police Service as reservists. "
"7052",2002,"Mbeki","Together, if each one of us lends a hand we can do much better. "
"7053",2002,"Mbeki","During the month of February, communities and their organisations have mobilised to enlist more volunteers. "
"7054",2002,"Mbeki","Sustained throughout the year, and with each one making a contribution, we can surpass the 30 000 target set by the Police Service.  "
"7055",2002,"Mbeki","The Police and the Department of Justice will continue their interaction with communities and organisations to ensure that particular attention is paid to assisting in such areas as clerical work in police stations, as well as in the courts, so we are able massively to reduce the backlog of cases pending trial. "
"7056",2002,"Mbeki","Legal and other professionals, students and other sections in our communities can play an important role in this regard.  "
"7057",2002,"Mbeki","Having set itself the target of stabilising 145 police station areas where over 50% of crimes are committed within three years, our security agencies have managed to attain this in one year.  "
"7058",2002,"Mbeki","More attention in the coming period will also be paid to improving the intelligence capacity of our security agencies, particularly to build on the successes that have been made in dealing with organised crime.  "
"7059",2002,"Mbeki","As we said earlier, these trends in crime incidents as well as other problems within society, including white-collar crime, call for partnership across society to improve our moral fibre to strengthen community bonds, to pull together in the direction of hope and success.  "
"7060",2002,"Mbeki","Consultations have started with various organised formations to convene a Moral Regeneration Summit as a matter of urgency. "
"7061",2002,"Mbeki","Such a Summit should address the issue of the responsibility that each and all of us should take for our lives, moving from the understanding that, as we were our own liberators in resistance against apartheid, so too should we today act as our own liberators in dealing with this legacy.  "
"7062",2002,"Mbeki","Moral regeneration also means inculcating in us and our youth that service to the people, selfless commitment to the common good, is more valuable than selfish pursuit of material rewards. "
"7063",2002,"Mbeki","Productive investment is more valuable than aimless gambling in markets for derivatives. "
"7064",2002,"Mbeki","Payment for honest work is more fulfilling and sustainable than theft. "
"7065",2002,"Mbeki","Children and women are there to be respected, not to become targets of abuse.  "
"7066",2002,"Mbeki","As part of the people's campaign Vuk� uzenzele, we must intensify our work on the questions of social equity. "
"7067",2002,"Mbeki","We do this as a continuation of our struggle and in order to fulfil the commitments made with the rest of humanity at the World Conference against Racism that we had the honour to host last year.  "
"7068",2002,"Mbeki","In this regard, we must ensure that we accelerate and entrench the forward march of women's emancipation in all spheres of our lives. "
"7069",2002,"Mbeki","As in the past, government must take a lead in promoting and protecting the rights of women.  "
"7070",2002,"Mbeki","We also need to reflect, as a nation, whether we are making the necessary progress in advancing the constitutional rights of the disabled people.  "
"7071",2002,"Mbeki","Further, part of our programme to bring about social equity is the successful implementation of the programme for Black Economic Empowerment.  "
"7072",2002,"Mbeki","Clearly, we need rigorous and visible progress in this area, so as to ensure not only the distribution of wealth and economic power in line with the demographics of our country; but also to ensure that our economy and society as a whole can benefit from the wisdom and potential of all South Africans, and that the benefits of such empowerment are shared across society, and not just by a few. "
"7073",2002,"Mbeki","Government has accepted the most critical recommendations of the Black Economic Empowerment Commission. "
"7074",2002,"Mbeki","On the two specific areas of legislation and institutional frameworks, it has been decided as follows: * All sectoral legislation will be examined to ensure that the obligation of Black Economic Empowerment is incorporated, on the basis of common principles agreed upon. "
"7075",2002,"Mbeki","* Once a comprehensive policy statement on this issue has been finalised, within the next four months, a Black Economic Empowerment Council will be established, bringing together government and other experts and practitioners in this critical area. "
"7076",2002,"Mbeki","* Government will, as an actor in the economic arena, particularly with regard to the massive procurement of goods and services, re-examine its structures and systems to ensure that they fully meet the objective of Black Economic Empowerment.  "
"7077",2002,"Mbeki","I would like to emphasise that the task of Black Economic Empowerment faces all sectors of society, including the established business community. "
"7078",2002,"Mbeki","As is happening in the tourism industry, progress will depend on active government leadership and co-operation from various sectors of the business community itself. "
"7079",2002,"Mbeki","I wish to thank Cyril Ramaphosa for his efforts in producing the report.  "
"7080",2002,"Mbeki","A further challenge in ensuring inclusive economy, pertains to access to micro-finance. "
"7081",2002,"Mbeki","Many enterprising South Africans set out to establish small businesses but are unable to do so through the formal banking system, nor to acquire the training that they need. "
"7082",2002,"Mbeki","Khula and Ntsika were established to spearhead this, and they have been improving their work in the past few years.  "
"7083",2002,"Mbeki","In order to ensure that the wisdom of the nation is tapped effectively, and that ideas are processed into practical programmes as urgently as possible, government will continue with intense consultations on micro-lending for the poor for purposes of income generation, working with experts who, by definition should include communities who have over the years run successful self-help financial schemes.  "
"7084",2002,"Mbeki","Combined with this initiative will be a comprehensive review of all institutions mandated to assist Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs).  "
"7085",2002,"Mbeki","Last year, government announced a series of interventions by the State to help speed up the rate of investment and job creation. "
"7086",2002,"Mbeki","This we did having come to the conclusion that the country had achieved macroeconomic stability.  "
"7087",2002,"Mbeki","We should at the very outset make bold to say that that conclusion stands. "
"7088",2002,"Mbeki","Growth of our economy in 2001 is expected to register more than 2% of Gross Domestic Product, a significant achievement given the global slowdown. "
"7089",2002,"Mbeki","Interest rates, though still high, are lower than they have been for many years; and the same can be said about inflation.  "
"7090",2002,"Mbeki","The budget deficit is much lower; and combined with revenue collection which is above the set targets, this will afford us the possibility to expand expenditure in real terms, especially on such important areas as social services and economic infrastructure.  "
"7091",2002,"Mbeki","In other words, barring the exchange rate, all critical economic indicators have improved.  "
"7092",2002,"Mbeki","The changing structure of our economy for the better is reflected, among other things, in the increase in manufactured exports, and the fact that high rates of growth can be attained without undue pressure on the balance of payments.  "
"7093",2002,"Mbeki","We are as a country within our right to be concerned about the volatility in the exchange rate, and the kind of inexplicable movements that we experienced towards the end of last year. "
"7094",2002,"Mbeki","A variety of reasons have been given in this respect; and we all await the outcome of the inquiry headed by Justice Myburgh, whom we wish to thank, along with other Commissioners and their staff, for accepting the request to assist the nation in getting to the root of this problem.  "
"7095",2002,"Mbeki","As government, we are in no doubt that the sudden depreciation of the currency a few months ago is not a reflection of systemic or structural weaknesses in the economy as a whole.  "
"7096",2002,"Mbeki","We will need to continue working with international financial institutions and developing countries to fashion a global financial architecture that cushions so-called ""emerging markets"" from occasional market irrationality.  "
"7097",2002,"Mbeki","On the whole, we should emphasise that the path of an open economy that we have charted for ourselves is not up for review. "
"7098",2002,"Mbeki","As we find our way into the future, we shall not seek solace in the past.  "
"7099",2002,"Mbeki","The programme that we announced last year, to pay particular attention to a number of sectors of the economy will, during the course of this year, continue to unfold in the areas identified such as mining, agriculture, telecommunications, tourism and manufacturing. "
"7100",2002,"Mbeki","Many concrete steps have been taken to speed up work in these sectors, and the relevant Ministers will detail these in their briefings to parliament and the public. "
"7101",2002,"Mbeki","We shall here select a few areas for emphasis.  "
"7102",2002,"Mbeki","To start off with, a number of recent projects that have been brought to our attention, convince us that the future holds much promise in terms of direct investment.  "
"7103",2002,"Mbeki","Mvelaphanda Energy, working with a consortium of two American companies has invested more than half a billion Rand in the exploration of gas on the west coast. "
"7104",2002,"Mbeki","The consortium is exploring an area covering approximately 8 million acres within the Orange River Basin and has encountered excellent gas reserves, that will supply a new form of energy to our country. "
"7105",2002,"Mbeki","Mvelaphanda Energy will soon be announcing a R5 billion investment in this project.  "
"7106",2002,"Mbeki","Furthermore, a joint venture between a black empowerment company, Evertrade, and a Nasdaq-listed company will establish waste bin manufacturing facilities around the country for export, with earnings estimated at about R1,4 billion in the next seven years.  "
"7107",2002,"Mbeki","Harmony Gold has raised over R1 billion of foreign investments for the purchase of gold mines in the Free State.  "
"7108",2002,"Mbeki","To these we can add motor manufacturing companies, which this year invested in excess of R2 billion, an Irish clothing and textile enterprise and many others.  "
"7109",2002,"Mbeki","Interaction with our business community has reinforced our confidence regarding their commitment to the growth of our economy and the prosperity of our society. "
"7110",2002,"Mbeki","In this regard, we wish again to pay tribute to a South African patriot and leader, the late Marinus Daling, who departed from our midst a week ago.  "
"7111",2002,"Mbeki","From the interactions we have had with government and business leaders in the European Union, Japan, China, the US and other regions, including at the recent World Economic Forum in New York, it is quite clear that these trends will continue.  "
"7112",2002,"Mbeki","Critical in ensuring greater investment is the intensification of the work to build economic infrastructure and lower the cost of inputs. "
"7113",2002,"Mbeki","In this regard, progress has been made in finalising ports policy and starting the process that will see to improvements in their efficiency.  "
"7114",2002,"Mbeki","The Nqurha Industrial Development Zone has been designated and work on the port has started.  "
"7115",2002,"Mbeki","Despite the difficulties experienced during the course of the year, progress has been made in the restructuring of the telecommunications sector, transport, energy and other areas of economic and social infrastructure, with the primary aim of ensuring efficient and cost-effective service. "
"7116",2002,"Mbeki","In this context, the restructuring of State assets remains one of the primary areas of focus of the Government's programme.  "
"7117",2002,"Mbeki","One of the urgent tasks we have set ourselves is to finalise the setting up of a safety agency for our railways. "
"7118",2002,"Mbeki","In this context, we wish to express our sympathies with the families of the bereaved and the injured in the recent train accident in Kwa-Dukuza, KwaZulu-Natal.  "
"7119",2002,"Mbeki","We are highly appreciative of the agreement that has been reached in the transport sector, and Spoornet in particular, to determine the kind of restructuring that enjoys the confidence of all the major stakeholders, including the trade unions. "
"7120",2002,"Mbeki","Steadily, as these programmes reach their critical mass, their impact on the lives of all South Africans, including in the area of sustainable job-creation, will start to be felt.  "
"7121",2002,"Mbeki","The partnerships that we have referred to earlier contain within them possibilities for massive expansion of Community-based Public Works Programmes.  "
"7122",2002,"Mbeki","We also face the challenge of ensuring that the funds allocated to the National Skills Fund, Umsobomvu, infrastructure and the employment subsidy are spent with the efficiency demanded by the actual needs of our society.  "
"7123",2002,"Mbeki","Experience over the past few months has raised the question of the impact of the rapid depreciation of our currency on the lives of ordinary South Africans. "
"7124",2002,"Mbeki","It is a tribute to the changing structure of the economy that imported inflation has in recent years been kept to a minimum.  "
"7125",2002,"Mbeki","We should also congratulate the agricultural sector for the work that they have done to finalise the Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture, which addresses all the complex issues of research, equitable land distribution, assistance to small-scale farmers and so on. "
"7126",2002,"Mbeki","Government and the agricultural sector are working together urgently to move towards implementation of the Plan.  "
"7127",2002,"Mbeki","In a meeting of the Joint Working Groups of government with ""big business, black business, agriculture and labour"" last December, it was agreed to convene as early as possible a Growth and Development Summit to address the urgent challenges facing us in the economy and build an enduring partnership in which all of us can lend a hand in building a prosperous South Africa.  "
"7128",2002,"Mbeki","A critical element of this engagement - at least a basic outline of which will have to be elaborated before such a Summit - is a Social Accord or Compact among all role-players. "
"7129",2002,"Mbeki","We need to ensure that each sector lends a hand for higher growth, whose benefits can be shared equitably among all South Africans. "
"7130",2002,"Mbeki","This will mean, among other things, achieving congruence in expectations and certainty in such matters as inflation, wage and salary demands, rates of investments, positioning of the country in the global arena, our role in NEPAD, job-creation and poverty alleviation.  "
"7131",2002,"Mbeki","The approach to this critical initiative will be based among other things on the experiences already garnered in the Millennium Labour Council and Nedlac. "
"7132",2002,"Mbeki","Achieving this Compact is desirable if our economy is to develop to its full potential. "
"7133",2002,"Mbeki","Nay more, it is necessary if our society has to advance at the rate required by the social challenges we face.  "
"7134",2002,"Mbeki","Honourable Members, this spirit of service to society, Batho Pele, is what guides us as we pursue the restructuring of the Public Service. "
"7135",2002,"Mbeki","Though slow, progress is being made in negotiations with public sector unions as we try to forge a common understanding of the challenges of change, which should benefit employer and employee, the public servant and the public we are meant serve.  "
"7136",2002,"Mbeki","And steadily, through practical experience, for example in urban renewal and rural development programmes, in improving capacity in the Presidency, in the clusters of Ministers and Directors-General, and in the President's Coordinating Council and other institutions, integrated governance is becoming a reality.  "
"7137",2002,"Mbeki","During the course of this year, our country will celebrate the 5th anniversary of the adoption of our basic law. "
"7138",2002,"Mbeki","This is an occasion in which we pay tribute to those who led the negotiations process and the mass of our people who, ultimately, are the true midwives of our democracy.  "
"7139",2002,"Mbeki","The interactions that we have had with various communities especially during imbizo activities demonstrate that the people's wisdom in both policy development and implementation can only serve to enrich the quality of the services we render and make people-centred and people-driven development a living reality.  "
"7140",2002,"Mbeki","One of the injunctions of the Constitution is that we must set up a Commission on Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Rights and we have already tabled legislation in parliament in this regard.  "
"7141",2002,"Mbeki","In accordance with the Government's comprehensive Public Service Anti-corruption Strategy, we have introduced measures to ensure that the code of conduct is upheld and that all public service managers are subject to conflict of interest disclosures. "
"7142",2002,"Mbeki","To complement this, legislation to fight corruption will be brought before parliament during this session.  "
"7143",2002,"Mbeki","Among the matters that we will bring to successful conclusion this year is the definition of the role of traditional leaders in our system of government. "
"7144",2002,"Mbeki","The consultations that have taken place across the board have laid the basis for framework legislation.  "
"7145",2002,"Mbeki","We will also this year finalise the restructuring of our National Orders to reflect the art, symbolism and idiom of South Africa as a whole.  "
"7146",2002,"Mbeki","Work to build the Freedom Park Monument will start this year so that South Africans and the rest of humanity can celebrate this important shrine symbolising the rich heritage of our country in the evolution of the Earth, life and humanity and the struggle of part of that humanity for liberty.  "
"7147",2002,"Mbeki","It is therefore appropriate that this Monument is launched as we approach the end of the First Decade of Freedom in two years time. "
"7148",2002,"Mbeki","I would like to thank the Freedom Park Board for having appointed the Honourable Wally Serote to work as a full-time chairperson on the Freedom Park Monument so as to speed-up the process.  "
"7149",2002,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, Chairperson, what inspires us as we work with other leaders and peoples across the continent and further afield is to shape a new world, defined by the needs of all humanity.  "
"7150",2002,"Mbeki","We enter the year 2002 with Africa, through its representative structures having formally embraced the commitment that this should, in actual practice, be the African Century.  "
"7151",2002,"Mbeki","Various projects envisaged in NEPAD will start to unfold in parts of the continent, as we turn the ideals in this document into practical action. "
"7152",2002,"Mbeki","During the course of last year, our commitment to Africa's progress also found expression in the deployment of our sons and daughters in uniform in Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. "
"7153",2002,"Mbeki","We did so because we remain confident that our sister-people in these countries will find solutions to their problems.  "
"7154",2002,"Mbeki","We are humbled to play host to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue, which commences this month in our country.  "
"7155",2002,"Mbeki","In order to ensure that we stay true to our commitment to peace on the continent and other defence functions, we shall continue with the programme to equip our National Defence Force in line with policies of the country adopted by its elected representatives.  "
"7156",2002,"Mbeki","In pursuit of stability in our region, we will work tirelessly to support the people of Zimbabwe in their quest to hold free and fair elections in their country.  "
"7157",2002,"Mbeki","It is in the interest of the people of Zimbabwe and, indeed, the whole region that the Government that emerges from the March elections is legitimate and enjoys the support of the majority.  "
"7158",2002,"Mbeki","In order to play our part in ensuring that this happens, and in response to the wishes of Zimbabweans themselves, we will, within a week, send a multi-sectoral South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe, led by Dr Sam Motsuenyane. "
"7159",2002,"Mbeki","I am informed that Parliament is also ready to send a Parliamentary Observer Team on the same issue.  "
"7160",2002,"Mbeki","Clearly, the mission and the conditions that our teams seek to create are one and only one: let the people of Zimbabwe speak through the ballot box!  "
"7161",2002,"Mbeki","Further, we wish to express our solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Lesotho who are due to hold their national elections in May this year after a long process of negotiations among themselves.  "
"7162",2002,"Mbeki","This year, we will continue with efforts to attain peace and development in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola and the Comoros.  "
"7163",2002,"Mbeki","We shall also persist with whatever we can contribute to ensure that the destruction of the Palestinian Authority is brought to an end, and that peace and security for the Palestinian and Israeli children become a reality.  "
"7164",2002,"Mbeki","Again, we shall during the course of the year, continue to strengthen economic and other forms of co-operation with countries of the European Union, Japan and the rest of Asia, China, the USA and the Americas, in pursuit of Africa's development, our own national interests and the interests of humanity as a whole. "
"7165",2002,"Mbeki","In this regard, we shall continue to challenge a pessimism that expects Africa to fail in any of its endeavours, and the undeclared doctrine of collective punishment against all Africans that seems to come into effect when one or some among our leaders stumble.  "
"7166",2002,"Mbeki","We wish once more to reiterate our solidarity with the people of the United States for the terrible events of 11 September 2001. "
"7167",2002,"Mbeki","If anything, our fervent hope is that this tragedy will continue to re-awaken in all of us, our bonds as a global human family. "
"7168",2002,"Mbeki","Along with other countries, under the aegis of the United Nations, South Africa will make whatever modest contribution it can in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.  "
"7169",2002,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker, Chairperson, the ingredients for faster progress on all fronts of our work are there. "
"7170",2002,"Mbeki","The primary one among these is our collective appreciation that no one, and no one, can do for us what we should do for ourselves.  "
"7171",2002,"Mbeki","In this programme, we lay out the main challenges that face us in the coming year and beyond. "
"7172",2002,"Mbeki","What guides our approach is that each one of us should lend a hand in doing the simple things that will make a difference to the lives of especially the poor.  "
"7173",2002,"Mbeki","Together as a people, we have made great strides. "
"7174",2002,"Mbeki","The successes we have achieved make the clear statement that acting together, we can and shall continue to push back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to a better life.  "
"7175",2002,"Mbeki","Thank you very much."
"7176",2001,"Mbeki"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker, Deputy President, Jacob Zuma, Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, President Mandela and Mrs. "
"7177",2001,"Mbeki","Machel; Honourable Members of our National Parliament, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, President of the Constitutional Court, The Acting Chief Justice and other members of our judiciary, Heads of the Security Services, Governor of the Reserve Bank, Honourable Premiers and MECs, Traditional leaders, Representatives of Local Government, Your Excellencies Ambassadors and High Commissioners, Distinguished guests, Fellow South Africans:  Gradually, step by step, our country proceeds further away from its painful past. "
"7178",2001,"Mbeki","We, its citizens, who are very close to the coalface of change may not easily see the steady transformation that informs all aspects of our national life.  "
"7179",2001,"Mbeki","The past of which I speak is well known to all of us.  "
"7180",2001,"Mbeki","It is a past of a racially divided country, of masters and servants, of racially inspired conflict and mistrust.  "
"7181",2001,"Mbeki","It is a past of endemic and widespread poverty and gross imbalances in levels of development and the distribution of wealth, income and opportunity. "
"7182",2001,"Mbeki","It is a past of an economy that was immersed in a crisis that was destined to worsen.  "
"7183",2001,"Mbeki","It is a past of the denial of freedom to the majority, gross violation of human rights and repression, of entrenched sexism, a past of high levels of crime, violence and corruption.  "
"7184",2001,"Mbeki","It is a past of a South Africa isolated from the rest of Africa and the world, a pariah among the nations.  "
"7185",2001,"Mbeki","It is away from this painful past that our country is progressing and must progress.  "
"7186",2001,"Mbeki","Our first responsibility in this regard has been the need for us to recognise the reality that as a people we do indeed share this common legacy.  "
"7187",2001,"Mbeki","Secondly, we had to make the determination that this was a legacy that we did not desire and were therefore committed to eradicate.  "
"7188",2001,"Mbeki","I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all our people, both black and white, who, in the past year and before, made a contribution, however small, towards the new advances of our country further away from its painful past.  "
"7189",2001,"Mbeki","In my own contacts with our people I meet the constant refrain - what can I do to help build a better South Africa!  "
"7190",2001,"Mbeki","These ordinary but truly heroic South Africans are not daunted by the difficulties they know we confront. "
"7191",2001,"Mbeki","They are not discouraged or overwhelmed by the litany of negative messages about our country to which all of us are exposed daily.  "
"7192",2001,"Mbeki","They see no benefit for themselves or our country in highlighting the deficiencies of our society and minimising the achievements we have scored collectively.  "
"7193",2001,"Mbeki","Indeed the difficulties that our country faces serve as an imperative to these fellow South Africans to persist along their chosen path of working even harder to build a new society.  "
"7194",2001,"Mbeki","It is thanks to their common efforts that we can make bold to say that we have continued to move forward away from our painful past. "
"7195",2001,"Mbeki","To build on these constructive efforts, we call on all our people across the colour line to dedicate this year to building unity in action for change.  "
"7196",2001,"Mbeki","Such unity in action among all South Africans should include joint efforts to implement the decisions taken at the National Conference on Racism. "
"7197",2001,"Mbeki","I wish once more to pledge that the Government will discharge its own responsibilities in this regard to assist our country to move away from its painful past of racism and sexism. "
"7198",2001,"Mbeki","Furthermore, we would like to reiterate our thanks to the Human Rights Commission for the holding of this successful conference.  "
"7199",2001,"Mbeki","We call on all our people individually and collectively to join in this campaign themselves to become activists in the historic process to transform ours into a truly non-racial country.  "
"7200",2001,"Mbeki","In this regard, I would like to congratulate Carl Niehaus, Mary Burton, Antjie Krog and others for their initiative to contribute to the socio-economic upliftment of their black fellow South Africans. "
"7201",2001,"Mbeki","There are others in our society who have also provided the lead and therefore also deserve a sincere word of appreciation.  "
"7202",2001,"Mbeki","These include Afrikaner farmers and professionals and historically white schools who have voluntarily decided to devote time and resources to the development of the disadvantaged sections of our population.  "
"7203",2001,"Mbeki","All of us are aware that later this year, we will be hosting the critically important UN Conference on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.  "
"7204",2001,"Mbeki","The peoples of the world are approaching this Conference with the greatest seriousness and expect that it will result in important new initiatives in the global struggle to combat racism. "
"7205",2001,"Mbeki","As the host country and given our own experience of racism, we are expected to make a significant contribution to the success of the Conference.  "
"7206",2001,"Mbeki","We will therefore have to take the necessary steps further to develop a national consensus on this matter and to demonstrate to the whole world the practical resolve of all our people to push back the frontiers of racism and xenophobia in our own country.  "
"7207",2001,"Mbeki","During the past year, we also took important steps towards the further consolidation of our non-racial democracy. "
"7208",2001,"Mbeki","I refer in this instance to the demarcation process, the establishment of the new municipalities and the holding of the municipal elections.  "
"7209",2001,"Mbeki","Through these processes, we have deracialised and strengthened local government as well as ensured the legitimacy of the new municipal councils, due to the fact that the elections were free and fair.  "
"7210",2001,"Mbeki","All this puts the country as a whole in a strong position to make further advances in increasing the capacity of the people to participate in the process of determining their future.  "
"7211",2001,"Mbeki","The requirements on the municipal councils to elaborate and adopt integrated development plans and to establish ward committees to facilitate regular communication between the councillors and the people are important instruments towards the realisation of the objective that the people shall govern.  "
"7212",2001,"Mbeki","More work remains to be done to ensure the effective functioning of our new municipal councils. "
"7213",2001,"Mbeki","This will include the creation of effective management and administrative machineries in every municipality, the proper integration of the formerly different areas and the implementation of development programmes, including those focused on poverty alleviation.  "
"7214",2001,"Mbeki","There are other outstanding matters such as the proper definition of the role of traditional authorities, the remuneration of the councillors and ironing out problems affecting the cross-border municipalities. "
"7215",2001,"Mbeki","All these are receiving urgent attention.  "
"7216",2001,"Mbeki","Recognising the fact that we still have this outstanding work, nevertheless we would like to congratulate the Demarcation Board, the Independent Electoral Commission, the various organs of government, the political parties, the traditional leaders and our people as a whole, for combining their efforts to bring about the excellent progress we have made further to entrench our democratic system and enhance the capacity of government to contribute to the realisation of the goal of a better life for all.  "
"7217",2001,"Mbeki","These important successes demonstrate practically what we can achieve if indeed, as a country and a people, we unite in action for change.  "
"7218",2001,"Mbeki","During the past year, we also made new advances in what must continue as a sustained offensive against poverty and underdevelopment.  "
"7219",2001,"Mbeki","By December 2000, the cumulative total for houses completed or under construction was 1, 129, 612 while subsidies allocated amounted to 1, 323, 205. "
"7220",2001,"Mbeki","During the year 2000, 397 019 electricity grid connections to homes were made.  "
"7221",2001,"Mbeki","The cumulative figure for the supply of clean water provided through the Community Supply Programme has increased a hundred fold from 62, 249 in 1995 to 6, 495, 205 by November 2000.  412, 000 new telephone lines were installed in the financial year 1999 to 2000 and 127 clinics built in the year 2000.  "
"7222",2001,"Mbeki","In the period from 1994 to November 2000, 917, 220 hectares of land was handed over to new black land owners through the government's redistribution and restitution processes. 37, 396 households benefited from the land redistribution process.  "
"7223",2001,"Mbeki","Statistics South Africa also reported that, according to its October Household Survey released in July 2000, during the period 1996 to 1999, total employment increased from 9.3 million to 10.4 million, representing a net gain of 1.1 million jobs.  "
"7224",2001,"Mbeki","It is also interesting to note that the Bureau of Market Research of UNISA reports in its categorisations that between 1995 and 2000, real personal disposable income of Indians increased annually by 2,8 per cent, the figure being 2,7 per cent for Africans, 2,1 per cent for Coloureds and 1,1 per cent for whites.  "
"7225",2001,"Mbeki","Despite all these advances we are still faced with a daunting backlog of poverty and maldistribution of income and wealth as recently reported by the UNISA Bureau for Market Research.  "
"7226",2001,"Mbeki","Reflecting the persistence of poverty among the Africans as well as disparities even at the high income levels, the BMR reports that more than 84 per cent of the low income accrued to Africans. 71,9 per cent of income earned by the high income group went to whites and 22 per cent to Africans.  "
"7227",2001,"Mbeki","We must also continue to be concerned about the slow progress being made with regard to the important issue of achieving gender equality. "
"7228",2001,"Mbeki","Further disaggregation of the economic figures we have quoted would show that the most disadvantaged in our country are black women.  "
"7229",2001,"Mbeki","The government itself has failed to achieve the necessary progress on gender equity even in the area of employment.  "
"7230",2001,"Mbeki","The National Gender Audit carried out by the Office on the Status of Women shows that in September 2000, women constituted only 16 per cent of the complement of senior managers in government, despite the target set by the Department of Public Service and Administration of 30 per cent.  "
"7231",2001,"Mbeki","On a more positive note, however, the figure for Gauteng Province was 37 per cent in 11 departments and 28 per cent in six departments in the Northern Cape.  "
"7232",2001,"Mbeki","During the past year the economy also continued to improve in an impressive manner. "
"7233",2001,"Mbeki","A strong base has been created for an even better performance this year.  "
"7234",2001,"Mbeki","The December 2000 Quarterly Bulletin of the South African Reserve Bank reported that:  "" The South African economy gathered considerable momentum in the third quarter of 2000. "
"7235",2001,"Mbeki","The strong growth in the second half of 1999...was largely restored in the third quarter. "
"7236",2001,"Mbeki","Stronger growth in manufacturing production resumed and real income in the agricultural sector rose vigorously..."
"7237",2001,"Mbeki","Growth in real gross domestic product approached 4 per cent in the third quarter of 2000...considerably firmer than the average annualised growth ...in the first half of 2000...  "
"7238",2001,"Mbeki",""" The national accounts showed continued growth in real final household spending in the third quarter...  "
"7239",2001,"Mbeki",""" A favourable external environment, continued growth in domestic final spending, rising profitability and the availability of investable funds provided the incentives for the business sector to raise its capital expenditure further in the third quarter...  "
"7240",2001,"Mbeki",""" The surplus of the financial account of the balance of payments exceeded by a considerable margin the absolute value of the deficit on the current account, raising the country's international reserve holdings to their highest level ever.""  "
"7241",2001,"Mbeki","The Bulletin goes on to note other positive developments such as:  * the ""expansion of (electricity...and water) services to the rural areas of the country""; * ""the (further) development of housing infrastructure"" * ""higher real household income and the reduced personal tax burden""; * ""the ongoing buoyancy of the telecommunications subsector where the expansion in the cellular network and Internet activity continued, along with the expansion of telephone services to previously under-serviced areas""; * ""developments (in real final consumption expenditure by general government)...consistent with government's resolve to rein in government spending as part of a broader strategy that will create an environment conducive to enhanced economic growth and job creation""; * ""public corporations increased their capital spending as part of modernising strategies ahead of the expected increase in private-sector participation in these businesses..."
"7242",2001,"Mbeki","General government increased its capital outlays somewhat, mainly in the form of higher spending on roads infrastructure""; * ""Gross saving by general government, which turned from dissaving to positive saving for the first time in almost a decade in the second quarter of 2000, remained positive in the third quarter""; and, * ""an acceleration in the growth in real output per worker in the formal non-agricultural sectors from a year-on-year rate of 2,4 per cent in the first quarter of 1999 to 6,5 per cent in the first and second quarters of 2000.  "
"7243",2001,"Mbeki","The foreign trade surplus as at December 2000 was a record R9 billion.  "
"7244",2001,"Mbeki","The consumer inflation rate was 5,3 per cent in the year 2000, compared to 15,3 per cent in 1991.  "
"7245",2001,"Mbeki","Reflecting the truth of real increased business confidence, Nedcor's register of capital projects of more than R20 million showed an increase from R22 billion in 1999 to R48 billion last year.  "
"7246",2001,"Mbeki","Furthermore, the current decline in yields on government bonds to record lows, while the share market is approaching its record highs, show that the financial markets have confidence in the government's fiscal policy, the monetary policy of the Reserve Bank and the ability of South African business and our citizens to deliver a better life for all.  "
"7247",2001,"Mbeki","Our country jumped 14 places in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2000, rising from 47 out of 49 countries surveyed in 1999 to 33 out of 59 in last year's report.  "
"7248",2001,"Mbeki","The overall situation on our Continent also continued to improve, marked by such important events as the elections in Ghana and the smooth hand over of power by the defeated former ruling party, and the signing of the cease-fire and peace agreement by Ethiopia and Eritrea.  "
"7249",2001,"Mbeki","Despite the difficult problems facing these two countries, steady progress is being made towards the resolution of the conflicts in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  "
"7250",2001,"Mbeki","As South Africans we should be proud to note that the past year has seen our country enhance its role as a reliable partner in the African and global struggle for democracy, peace, development and an equitable process of globalisation.  "
"7251",2001,"Mbeki","Quite clearly, a better global setting will help us greatly as we pursue the national effort to secure a better life for all our people, which, in turn will give us better opportunities to discharge our own international responsibilities. "
"7252",2001,"Mbeki","A better Africa and a better world are in the genuine interest of South Africa's people.  "
"7253",2001,"Mbeki","In further pursuit of the objective of a better life for all and building on what has already been achieved, the government has decided on a programme of action for the year 2001.  "
"7254",2001,"Mbeki","I will now outline the principal elements of this programme of action, starting with the economy.  "
"7255",2001,"Mbeki","As part of the process of planning for the future, towards the end of last year we had occasion to draw on the advice of some of the world's top economists and analysts from a wide range of schools of thought.  "
"7256",2001,"Mbeki","There is a general consensus that we have established the necessary macro-economic balance and stability, away from the very precarious position we were in, in 1994, and despite a very volatile international environment.  "
"7257",2001,"Mbeki","Furthermore, the international competitiveness of the economy has fundamentally improved. "
"7258",2001,"Mbeki","The threat of de-industrialisation and economic collapse as a result of manufacturing sector inefficiency which we inherited, has been addressed through tariff and industrial reforms.  "
"7259",2001,"Mbeki","However the reality remains that our rate of growth is still too low as are the aggregate savings and investment rates. "
"7260",2001,"Mbeki","Similarly, the levels of poverty, unemployment and underdevelopment in some parts of our country are too high.  "
"7261",2001,"Mbeki","While continuing to focus on the maintenance of the correct macro-economic balances, we have therefore decided to pay detailed attention to the critical micro-economic issues.  "
"7262",2001,"Mbeki","In particular we have decided that this year the government itself, in all its spheres, and the public sector as a whole, must make a decisive and integrated contribution towards meeting the economic challenges the country faces.  "
"7263",2001,"Mbeki","The objectives we seek to achieve are moving the economy onto a high-growth path, increasing its competitiveness and efficiency, raising employment levels and reducing poverty and persistent inequalities.  "
"7264",2001,"Mbeki","To improve our competitiveness, we must lower input costs throughout the economy.  "
"7265",2001,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we have decided to go over to a managed liberalisation of the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors.  "
"7266",2001,"Mbeki","With regard to all these sectors, all outstanding policy matters, including the regulatory frameworks, will be addressed leading to the creation of the necessary climate of certainty for both public and private sector investors.  "
"7267",2001,"Mbeki","With regard to the energy sector, among other things, our decision will entail restructuring the electricity supply and distribution industries to introduce greater levels of competition. "
"7268",2001,"Mbeki","Independent Power Producers will be allowed into our energy system and localised energy grids for rural areas will be developed.  "
"7269",2001,"Mbeki","A Gas Bill will be tabled in parliament and gas from Mozambique, in the first instance, will provide a new energy source for industry and domestic consumers.  "
"7270",2001,"Mbeki","In the transport sector, among other things, new investments will be made and restructuring effected in the rail, road and port infrastructure, including the new port at Ngqura or Coega.  "
"7271",2001,"Mbeki","Ngqura/Coega will be the first Industrial Development Zone to be gazetted in March.  "
"7272",2001,"Mbeki","More efficient port operations, including the granting of concessions, as well as competitive tariffs will be introduced.  "
"7273",2001,"Mbeki","Steps will be taken to increase the number of flights to and from South Africa to assist with the promotion of tourism. "
"7274",2001,"Mbeki","A final decision will be taken on the King Shaka Airport in Durban.  "
"7275",2001,"Mbeki","With regard to the telecommunications sector, we will go ahead with the public listing of Telkom which is part of our broad programme of the restructuring of state assets. "
"7276",2001,"Mbeki","The outstanding matter of the third cellular licence will be resolved in time.  "
"7277",2001,"Mbeki","Further investments will be made in this sector.  "
"7278",2001,"Mbeki","The application of modern communication and information technology in the fields of education, health, commerce and government will be expedited.  "
"7279",2001,"Mbeki","As we have said, this year a greater degree of certainty will be reached with respect to the policy and regulatory regime of the telecommunications sector.  "
"7280",2001,"Mbeki","Because of the critical importance of this sector, we will also establish two bodies to assist the government as it works further to ensure that we do not fall further behind the rest of the world as a result of the digital divide.  "
"7281",2001,"Mbeki","The first of these will be a Presidential National Commission on Information Society and Development. "
"7282",2001,"Mbeki","This will be constituted from representatives of our country's public and private sectors.  "
"7283",2001,"Mbeki","The second will be a Presidential International Task Force on Information Society and Development. "
"7284",2001,"Mbeki","CEOs from major international corporations and experts active in the field of information and communication technology will constitute this Task force.  "
"7285",2001,"Mbeki","The members of the first of these bodies will be announced in the near future.  "
"7286",2001,"Mbeki","I am also pleased to announce that the information technology companies that will be part of the Presidential Commission have already expressed their determination to work with the Government significantly to increase the numbers of skilled people in this sector.  "
"7287",2001,"Mbeki","On behalf of the Government and all our people, I would like to thank all of them for their unequivocal commitment to helping our country to get onto and stay on the information super-highway.  "
"7288",2001,"Mbeki","I am also pleased and privileged to inform Parliament and the country of the names of the distinguished members of the International Task Force. "
"7289",2001,"Mbeki","These are:  * Mr Larry Ellison of Oracle; * Ms Carly Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard; * Ms Esther Dyson of Edventure Holdings; * Mr Craig McCaw of Teledesic; * Professor Manuel Castell of the University of California; * Mr de Beauce of Vivendi; * Mr Serge Tchuruk of Alcatel; * Mr Rajendra Pawar of NIIT of India; * Mr David Porter of Psion; * Dr Jung of Siemens; * Dr Henry Chasia of Telehouse Space Ltd. "
"7290",2001,"Mbeki","* Mr Shuttleworth of Thwate Consulting of South Africa.  "
"7291",2001,"Mbeki","We expect to receive some additional names in the near future.  "
"7292",2001,"Mbeki","We have identified other sectors of our economy that require special attention because of their potential to contribute especially to the objectives of higher growth rates and job creation.  "
"7293",2001,"Mbeki","These include agriculture, tourism, certain export sectors, cultural industries and the information and communication sector.  "
"7294",2001,"Mbeki","The specific export sectors we are referring to are agro-processing, automobiles and components, mining technology and minerals beneficiation and clothing and textiles.  "
"7295",2001,"Mbeki","In addition to lowering input costs and improving competitiveness, these sectors will be stimulated through specific policy and regulatory actions that will be effected this year.  "
"7296",2001,"Mbeki","While not detracting from the state's ongoing efforts to maintain and sustain other sectors of the economy, different and additional actions will be taken this year to reinforce the growth of the sectors we have mentioned.  "
"7297",2001,"Mbeki","We may perhaps mention some specifics relating to tourism to illustrate the kind of attention the government will give to the identified sectors.  "
"7298",2001,"Mbeki","The Business Trust has already announced its decision to help create 3000 new black-owned tourism enterprises. "
"7299",2001,"Mbeki","This year, the Government and the Trust will fund 3000 learnerships in this sector.  "
"7300",2001,"Mbeki","Major public sector investments have already been made in the Lubombo SDI and money will also be put into the Wild Coast SDI, including the rerouting and maintenance of the N2.  "
"7301",2001,"Mbeki","Space has been and will be created for the private sector to invest in these and other SDIs, continuing our effort to build public-private-sector partnerships.  "
"7302",2001,"Mbeki","New initiatives will be undertaken by National Parks in all the areas under its control to improve and increase the tourism infrastructure without damaging the eco-environment, bring in private sector investment, absorb larger numbers of tourists, increase job opportunities and other benefits especially to the surrounding communities, and preserve the national heritage, such as our rich collection of rock art.  "
"7303",2001,"Mbeki","We will take further steps to encourage the opening of trans-frontier parks with our neighbours while continuing to focus on such other important issues as waste management, desertification, climate change, persistent organic pollutants and land management.  "
"7304",2001,"Mbeki","Of course, we will also pay special attention to the preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development which we will host next year and which will bring an estimated 50 000 people to our country.  "
"7305",2001,"Mbeki","We must also report that the public-private sector International Marketing Council has already begun its work. "
"7306",2001,"Mbeki","We are certain that it will assist greatly to build a positive image for our country based on a more accurate and objective understanding of the advances we are making and the better future we are building for ourselves.  "
"7307",2001,"Mbeki","We have also taken the necessary decisions with regard to the improvement of the conditions that underpin and constitute the enabling framework for economic efficiency and competitiveness.  "
"7308",2001,"Mbeki","I refer here to human resource development, technology, the economic infrastructure and access to capital.  "
"7309",2001,"Mbeki","Honourable Members will agree that welcome progress is being made in the efforts to improve the quality of education, including the provision of infrastructure, consolidating the culture of learning and teaching, and introducing Adult Basic Education. "
"7310",2001,"Mbeki","However, much more needs to be done to improve our skills base.  "
"7311",2001,"Mbeki","In this regard, Government has approved a Human Resource Development Strategy that will enable us to launch an accelerated skills development programme for those areas that are critical to a more competitive economy.  "
"7312",2001,"Mbeki","Immigration laws and procedures will be reviewed urgently to enable us to attract skills into our country. "
"7313",2001,"Mbeki","Improvements in maths and science education will also be prioritised.  "
"7314",2001,"Mbeki","We recognise the fact that competitiveness is driven by technological advances and innovation. "
"7315",2001,"Mbeki","In recognition of this, investment in research and development is one of the focal points of our integrated plan aimed at attaining a cutting edge in key areas such as biotechnology.  "
"7316",2001,"Mbeki","At the same time, we will continue with the consultations aimed at reforming the labour market, as well as investigations into the feasibility of reducing the cost of labour without reducing workers' wages.  "
"7317",2001,"Mbeki","Investment in the economic infrastructure will be prioritised to support the high-growth areas, the integrated rural development strategy and the urban renewal programme. "
"7318",2001,"Mbeki","An additional R6 billion has been set aside for this purpose over the next three years.  "
"7319",2001,"Mbeki","The Government remains concerned that access to capital, which is key to economic growth and the development of the small and medium enterprise sector in the economy, remains difficult for the majority. "
"7320",2001,"Mbeki","We need to develop the capacity to make such access easier while retaining a well managed financial sector.  "
"7321",2001,"Mbeki","Accordingly, the regulation of the financial services sector will be reviewed this year. "
"7322",2001,"Mbeki","New partnerships with financial institutions will be explored and the micro-finance sector will be mobilised in support of entrepreneurship and productive activities.  "
"7323",2001,"Mbeki","The success of the integrated action plan we have just detailed will be measured by how it impacts positively on a number of key performance indicators including economic growth rates, employment levels, competitiveness, black economic empowerment and small business development.  "
"7324",2001,"Mbeki","For us to achieve maximum results with regard to these economic initiatives will require not only the commitment and energetic involvement of the government but the building of a strong partnership with both business and labour.  "
"7325",2001,"Mbeki","I therefore renew our appeal to our social partners to work together with us in a mutually beneficial partnership for change.  "
"7326",2001,"Mbeki","On previous occasions we have reported that we were working on both an integrated rural development strategy as well as an urban renewal programme.  "
"7327",2001,"Mbeki","In both instances our central aim is to conduct a sustained campaign against rural and urban poverty and underdevelopment, bringing in the resources of all three spheres of government in a co-ordinated manner.  "
"7328",2001,"Mbeki","These programmes will, among other things, entail investment in the economic and social infrastructure, human resource development, enterprise development, the enhancement of the development capacity of local government, poverty alleviation and the strengthening of the criminal justice system.  "
"7329",2001,"Mbeki","The new structure of local government, in urban and rural areas, will be the focal institution of government to ensure the co-ordinated implementation of our programmes, with the Ministry of Provincial and Local Government acting as the national co-ordinating ministry.  "
"7330",2001,"Mbeki","Success in this work should have a positive impact on such areas as job creation, crime and violence, health and the general quality of life of millions of our people who lead desperate lives.  "
"7331",2001,"Mbeki","Though it took longer than we thought in fact to elaborate realistic and integrated government plans, the individual departments and spheres of government have continued with their own programmes focused on these two matters of rural development and urban renewal.  "
"7332",2001,"Mbeki","For example, investments totalling more than R3 billion have been made through the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme over the last three years, with 47 per cent spent in rural areas and 53 per cent in the urban areas.  "
"7333",2001,"Mbeki","The work that will help us to move to a higher phase with regard to rural development has now been concluded. "
"7334",2001,"Mbeki","Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the urban renewal programme except in the instance of two areas.  "
"7335",2001,"Mbeki","In both instances, the nodal points for the implementation of these programmes have been identified. "
"7336",2001,"Mbeki","With regard to rural development, these are:  * The O.R. "
"7337",2001,"Mbeki","Tambo, North East, Ukhahlamba and EG Kei District Municipalities in the Eastern Cape; * The Umzinyathi, Umkhanyakude, Ugu and Zululand District Municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal; * The Kgalagadi Cross Boundary District Municipality in the Northern Cape and North West; * The Central Karoo District Municipality in the Western Cape. "
"7338",2001,"Mbeki","* The Sekhukhune Cross Boundary District Municipality in Mpumalanga and the Northern Province; * The Eastern District Municipality in the Northern Province; and, * The Qwaqwa District Municipality in the Free State.  "
"7339",2001,"Mbeki","With regard to the urban renewal programme, the areas identified include:  * Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain in the Western Cape; * KwaMashu and Inanda in KwaZulu-Natal; * Mdantsane and Motherwell in the Eastern Cape; * Alexandra Township in Gauteng; and, * Galeshewe in the Northern Cape.  "
"7340",2001,"Mbeki","With regard to these areas, we will only be able to act immediately with regard to Alexandra Township and KwaMashu. "
"7341",2001,"Mbeki","Work is going on to bring in the other areas as soon as possible.  "
"7342",2001,"Mbeki","Beginning from this year of the start of centenary celebrations in Alexandra Township, R1,3 billion spread over seven years will be set aside to embark on an integrated development programme that will deliver housing, roads, water, sanitation, schools, clinics, magistrate offices and police stations.  "
"7343",2001,"Mbeki","Again I would like to emphasise that this does not mean that no work is being done in other areas. "
"7344",2001,"Mbeki","What we are addressing here is the elaboration and implementation of the urban renewal programme bringing together all three spheres of government.  "
"7345",2001,"Mbeki","As we have already indicated, the success of these plans will also depend on the extent to which the people can be mobilised so that they become active participants in the processes targeted at the upliftment of their own communities.  "
"7346",2001,"Mbeki","We therefore repeat the call that we must all unite in action for change.  "
"7347",2001,"Mbeki","The social sector also has its own targeted programme of action focused on the social upliftment of especially the most disadvantaged in our society.  "
"7348",2001,"Mbeki","It will implement co-ordinated programmes in the nodal rural and urban areas we have identified which, among other things, will address such issues as housing, water, sanitation, health including HIV/AIDS, pension pay-outs, household food security and nutrition, poverty alleviation including the provision of certain amounts of free services, Home Affairs services, education and training, sport and culture.  "
"7349",2001,"Mbeki","Naturally, this does not mean that other areas of the country will be neglected.  "
"7350",2001,"Mbeki","The sector will also focus on the complete transfer to their occupants of as many municipal houses as possible of the remaining 350 000 properties.  "
"7351",2001,"Mbeki","Special attention will be paid to a more vigorous extension of the system of sanitation to contain the outbreak of water-borne diseases.  "
"7352",2001,"Mbeki","In addition to the continuing campaign against AIDS, a more comprehensive approach to the health challenge in our country will be adopted to ensure an effective response to all infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, STDs, cholera, and hepatitis.  "
"7353",2001,"Mbeki","Similarly, as already indicated in terms of some of the programmes we have already mentioned, we have to respond more decisively to other diseases of poverty such as those that are caused by vitamin, protein and energy deficiency.  "
"7354",2001,"Mbeki","Work will be completed on a comprehensive social security system to try to extend the safety net to as many people as possible, bearing in mind the resource constraints we face and the need to ensure that we do not impact negatively on economic spending.  "
"7355",2001,"Mbeki","We must again call on all our people to participate in the implementation of these programmes in the spirit of Masakhane.  "
"7356",2001,"Mbeki","The Government will continue to pay the necessary attention to the issue of crime. "
"7357",2001,"Mbeki","We are very conscious of the fact that the safety and security of all our citizens is a fundamental right and a critical element in our continuing efforts to improve the quality of life of all our people.  "
"7358",2001,"Mbeki","We want to arrive at the situation where all those who commit crime will know that they have nowhere to hide.  "
"7359",2001,"Mbeki","The priority areas of focus with regard to the crime prevention and combating strategy will remain:  * high crime areas; * organised crime, including urban terrorism; * crimes against women and children; * corruption; * cross border crime; and, * social crime prevention.  "
"7360",2001,"Mbeki","As we have already indicated, the areas chosen as the lead points in our urban renewal programme will also be particular points of focus for our criminal justice system.  "
"7361",2001,"Mbeki","The 124 priority police stations that we have identified in the past will also continue to receive the necessary attention and resources to enable them to do their work.  "
"7362",2001,"Mbeki","In addition to other measures aimed at increasing the numbers of police personnel, the South African Police Service will give all required assistance to the Metropolitan Councils to enable them to establish their municipal police services where these do not exist.  "
"7363",2001,"Mbeki","The National Directorate of Public Prosecutions and our courts will also continue with the measures they have already adopted to reduce and eliminate the unduly large backlog of cases that have not been tried.  "
"7364",2001,"Mbeki","Similarly, work will continue to find a solution to the problem of overcrowding in our prisons caused especially by the large numbers of awaiting-trial prisoners.  "
"7365",2001,"Mbeki","The criminal justice system will also further intensify its offensive against corruption among its own personnel. "
"7366",2001,"Mbeki","This will include the introduction of a new leadership at Correctional Services, an increase in intelligence resources dedicated to the fight against corruption and, where necessary, the expansion of the existing anti-corruption units.  "
"7367",2001,"Mbeki","Last July, the Minister of Safety and Security placed a moratorium on the use within the Police Service and the release of crime statistics. "
"7368",2001,"Mbeki","This was because of serious problems about the integrity and reliability of these statistics which, among other things, made it very difficult to design accurate and optimal operational plans in the fight against crime.  "
"7369",2001,"Mbeki","The point needs to be understood that perhaps more than anybody else, the Ministry and the Police Service constantly need accurate and up-to-date information on the incidence of crime to ensure proper deployment of human and material resources.  "
"7370",2001,"Mbeki","Accordingly, extensive work has been and is being carried out to ensure the availability of this information. "
"7371",2001,"Mbeki","This has included and will include the training of over 3000 people and the recruitment of about 600 people to specialise on the issue of crime information.  "
"7372",2001,"Mbeki","At this moment, it is expected that the moratorium will end at the end of June.  "
"7373",2001,"Mbeki","The criminal justice cluster will also intensify its efforts to encourage further community involvement in the fight against crime and corruption. "
"7374",2001,"Mbeki","This will include the recruitment of 30 000 reservists especially in the already identified high-crime areas.  "
"7375",2001,"Mbeki","Once more, this emphasises the importance of popular involvement in the common effort to change our country for the better.  "
"7376",2001,"Mbeki","The challenge of ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the structures of government extends beyond the criminal justice system. "
"7377",2001,"Mbeki","It affects the entirety of government.  "
"7378",2001,"Mbeki","The strengthening of the system of local government is one of the priorities the government has set itself.  "
"7379",2001,"Mbeki","We are also focusing on the improvement of the quality of service delivery and efficiency in the use of public resources in all areas of Government, among other things to overcome the problem of under spending which continues to plague us.  "
"7380",2001,"Mbeki","The gradual introduction of e-government will assist us greatly to overcome these problems.  "
"7381",2001,"Mbeki","The sustained implementation of the government's human resource development programme to improve management and other skills as well as to enhance respect and observance of the principle of Batho Pele is also of critical importance to the achievement of our objectives.  "
"7382",2001,"Mbeki","We will soon convene a strategy meeting to assess progress and problems with regard to the fight against corruption, in particular, to ensure the implementation of decisions reached in the Summit held about two years back. "
"7383",2001,"Mbeki","We will continue to take all necessary steps to limit this unacceptable practice.  "
"7384",2001,"Mbeki","This will include thorough audits of some of the outgoing municipal councils after which decisive action will be taken against those found to have abused their positions for corrupt purposes.  "
"7385",2001,"Mbeki","As Parliament and the country are aware, a successful Public Service Job Summit was held at the end of last month.  "
"7386",2001,"Mbeki","I would like to quote some excerpts from the Preamble of the Framework Agreement arrived at, to show the commitment of the Government and the public sector unions to serve the people of South Africa.  "
"7387",2001,"Mbeki",""" The parties to the Public Service Job Summit meet at a time in the history of our country when the challenge of managing a transformation process in the public service is upon each of us. "
"7388",2001,"Mbeki","It is a time when the parties face the twin challenge of transforming the public service to improve the reach, depth, efficiency and quality of social service delivery, whilst at the same time improving the conditions of service, quality and sustainability of jobs for employees of the public service.  "
"7389",2001,"Mbeki",""" The parties acknowledge that they share a common commitment to a broader interest of serving the South African nation. "
"7390",2001,"Mbeki","Accordingly the parties record their commitment to respect in words and deeds one another, and to live by the spirit and letter of this agreement which shall govern the objectives, principles and procedures for the management of the transformation process.""  "
"7391",2001,"Mbeki","The Government applauds these sentiments and commits itself to honour the agreement it has entered into.  "
"7392",2001,"Mbeki","Furthermore, we salute these freely agreed positions because they contain the important lesson for all of us that we need to unite in action to bring about the changes our country requires.  "
"7393",2001,"Mbeki","I am very pleased that we have among us the former Minister of Intelligence, the Hon Joe Nhlanhla, a principled and loyal patriot. "
"7394",2001,"Mbeki","The cruel misfortune of ill-health brought about by pressures of work has deprived all of us of his dedicated service.  "
"7395",2001,"Mbeki","I am certain that you all join me in wishing him the speediest recovery possible so that we could, once again, draw on his considerable talents.  "
"7396",2001,"Mbeki","We have entered the 21st century having resolved and declared to ourselves, as Africans, and to the rest of the world that, primarily, none but ourselves can extricate us and our Continent from the curse of poverty, underdevelopment and marginalisation.  "
"7397",2001,"Mbeki","The majority of people present in this Chamber are South African. "
"7398",2001,"Mbeki","Outwardly we are a people of many colours, races, cultures, languages and ancient origins. "
"7399",2001,"Mbeki","Yet we are tied to one another by a million visible and invisible threads.  "
"7400",2001,"Mbeki","We share a common destiny from which none of us can escape because together we are human, we are South African, we are African.  "
"7401",2001,"Mbeki","We have worked together for a decade to make of our country what for 300 years it was not. "
"7402",2001,"Mbeki","As a country, undoubtedly all of us will have made mistakes as we sought to build what had never been there, and will make yet more mistakes.  "
"7403",2001,"Mbeki","But we were right and did not make a mistake when we agreed together that we will transform this common troubled motherland and set about the task of transforming it into a country of democracy, peace, equality and prosperity.  "
"7404",2001,"Mbeki","Many on our Continent and elsewhere in the world were pleased to count this infant South Africa as one of the jewels on the African crown.  "
"7405",2001,"Mbeki","As these Africans of many races and colours we will and must work with the rest of our Continent and our partners across the globe to give life to a new Millennium African Recovery Programme.  "
"7406",2001,"Mbeki","Together, we must turn into reality a new internationalism that does not permit of the coexistence within human society of opulence and grinding poverty, of a thriving modernity and a dehumanising underdevelopment.  "
"7407",2001,"Mbeki","The burden of our prayer to you today has been that all of us must hold firm to the correct course we have chosen and hold firm to our resolve to walk that road together.  "
"7408",2001,"Mbeki","Ahead of us is a new century and a new millennium.  "
"7409",2001,"Mbeki","We march into the new era of the African Century as Africans who have made the determination that this century will be a hundred years in which we cease to be victims of our circumstances but become victors.  "
"7410",2001,"Mbeki","By what we do, we will ensure that wars, disease and underdevelopment are no longer seen as being synonymous with Africans.  "
"7411",2001,"Mbeki","Through our own actions we will ensure that poverty gives way to prosperity.  "
"7412",2001,"Mbeki","As we strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity with our fellow Africans we have an obligation to help ensure that, in our country and everywhere else on our Continent, no African child should ever again walk in fear of guns, tyrants and abuse; that no African child should ever again experience hunger, avoidable disease and ignorance; that no African child should ever again feel ashamed to be an African.  "
"7413",2001,"Mbeki","Our Government, democratically elected by the people of South Africa, will do its best to live up to these injunctions. "
"7414",2001,"Mbeki","We know it as a matter of fact that all men and women of conscience at home and everywhere else on our common planet will, themselves, take no other road but this one, for which many across the oceans describe ours as a land of hope.  "
"7415",2001,"Mbeki","Thank you."
"7416",2000,"Mbeki"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker, Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, Honourable Members of our National Legislature, President of the Constitutional Court, Chief Justice, Judges Heads of the Security Services, Honourable Premiers, Representatives of Local Government, Distinguished guests:  At no other point of time have we ever been as well placed as we are today to take decisive forward steps, towards the creation of the humane and people-centred society for which the organisations that were unbanned ten years ago struggled for many decades.  "
"7417",2000,"Mbeki","It is now ten years since the people's organisations were unbanned, the last political prisoners released and the exiles began the journey back to the land of their birth.  "
"7418",2000,"Mbeki","In the course of a mere decade, we ended the entrenched and pernicious system of apartheid white minority rule.  "
"7419",2000,"Mbeki","We have put in place a constitutionally governed and stable democratic system whose permanence has been underwritten by two successful general elections.  "
"7420",2000,"Mbeki","We have put behind us the practice inherent within our social order for three centuries and more, of the resolution of competing interests by resort to repression, to violence and war.  "
"7421",2000,"Mbeki","We have turned an economy that was headed towards a catastrophic meltdown into one that is poised to advance in a way that will address the needs of all our people.  "
"7422",2000,"Mbeki","Where suffering and degradation were the only things that were certain in the lives of millions of our people, we have created the situation in which these millions are now better able to carry their pain, because hope has taken the place of despair.  "
"7423",2000,"Mbeki","Having ended our dark days as a pariah country, we can rightly say that, today, the nations of our common universe are confident that out of South Africa will emerge a thing of value that will contribute to the building of a more humane world.  "
"7424",2000,"Mbeki","Surely, Madame Speaker, we are entitled to make the claim that, as a people, both black and white, we did, in a mere decade, carry out a multi-faceted task whose accomplishment speaks highly of the capacity of our people and all humanity to achieve results which can only be described as good and noble.  "
"7425",2000,"Mbeki","I am therefore privileged to have this opportunity to extend heartfelt congratulations to all our people, regardless of race, colour and gender, for the extraordinary and sustained effort over the last ten years which has enabled the overwhelming majority among us to say - we are proud to be South African!  "
"7426",2000,"Mbeki","The good that has been done puts into very sharp relief everything that still has to be done, to extricate millions of our people from the conditions of poverty, of racism, of sexism and violations of their human dignity, from which too many of our people continue to suffer.  "
"7427",2000,"Mbeki","However, I am certain that we are all inspired to act with greater vigour and will indeed act with greater vigour, to achieve the fundamental transformation of our country, because at no point during its entire history has our country been in a better position to confront the challenges we face than it is today.  "
"7428",2000,"Mbeki","At no other point of time have we ever been as well placed as we are today to take decisive forward steps, towards the creation of the humane and people-centred society for which the organisations that were unbanned ten years ago struggled for many decades.  "
"7429",2000,"Mbeki","Last month, the Food and Allied Workers Union came across correspondence in the electronic mail of one of our companies. "
"7430",2000,"Mbeki","This correspondence originated from an engineer within this company, who has since been dismissed.  "
"7431",2000,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members will recall, among other things, this engineer wrote:  "" I would like to summarise what the Kaffirs have done to stuff up this country since they came into power..."
"7432",2000,"Mbeki","If a white buys a house, he pays transfer duties. "
"7433",2000,"Mbeki","If a kaffir buys a house it is free of duties because he was 'previously disadvantaged'..."
"7434",2000,"Mbeki","More than 20% of the GDP is embezzled by the kaffir politicians and corrupt civil servants..."
"7435",2000,"Mbeki","The UIF and state pension funds have been embezzled..."
"7436",2000,"Mbeki","Our girlfriends/wives are in constant threat of being brutally raped by some AIDS infected Kaffir (or gang of Kaffirs)..."
"7437",2000,"Mbeki","Everyday someone you know is either robbed, assaulted, hijacked or murdered..."
"7438",2000,"Mbeki","Half these black bastards have bought their (drivers) licences from corrupt traffic cops...."
"7439",2000,"Mbeki","All I am saying is that AIDS isn't working fast enough!!!""  "
"7440",2000,"Mbeki","Our successes in the struggle to move our country from apartheid to democracy have led many in our country to reach the premature conclusion that racism in South Africa is dead.  "
"7441",2000,"Mbeki","This is despite the obvious and naked fact that to this day and unavoidably, the racial divisions, inequalities and prejudices of the past continue to characterise our society.  "
"7442",2000,"Mbeki","Some in our country are so determined to close their eyes to this reality that those who are forced to swallow the bitter fruit of racial inequality and arrogance are regularly rebuked for speaking out against the pain they continue to endure.  "
"7443",2000,"Mbeki","Such unadorned statements as those made by the company engineer serve a very important function in that they bring us face to face with the brutality of the racism that will continue to exist in our society unless all of us engage this monster consciously and systematically.  "
"7444",2000,"Mbeki","After discussions between the Government and the Human Rights Commission, agreement has been reached that the Commission will, later this year, convene a National Congress against Racism.  "
"7445",2000,"Mbeki","We are convinced that this important initiative will help to move our country faster towards the realisation of the goal contained in our Constitution of the creation of a non-racial society, as well as impact positively on our continuing struggle for a non-sexist society.  "
"7446",2000,"Mbeki","During this year, the Government will therefore give all necessary support to the Human Rights Commission to ensure that it succeeds to engage all sectors of our society in the common effort further to intensify our offensive against racism and sexism.  "
"7447",2000,"Mbeki","Next year, at the request of the United Nations Human Rights Commission and High Commissioner Mary Robinson, our country will also host the International Conference against Racism.  "
"7448",2000,"Mbeki","We feel greatly honoured that the international community, in recognition of our commitment to the struggle for a non-racial world, should have chosen our country to host such an important international gathering, which will be the first of its kind.  "
"7449",2000,"Mbeki","The Honourable Members will have taken note of the deep concern expressed by various European governments at the growth of the extreme right wing in their part of the world.  "
"7450",2000,"Mbeki","In one of his plays, the Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, the outstanding German playwright and poet, Bertold Brecht, warns against the resurgence of fascism with the unforgettable words - the bitch is in heat again!  "
"7451",2000,"Mbeki","We are committed to act in unity with the rest of the world to confront this challenge and will therefore begin the work this year, together with and under the guidance of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, to ensure that the international conference next year discharges its responsibilities to the peoples of the world.  "
"7452",2000,"Mbeki","Because we have never been better placed than we are today further to push back the frontiers of racism, we are convinced that our own National Congress against Racism will also succeed to discharge its responsibilities to our people.  "
"7453",2000,"Mbeki","I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Honourable Members for the work they did to approve on time, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act and the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act.  "
"7454",2000,"Mbeki","We have assented to these and other pieces of legislation approved last month.  "
"7455",2000,"Mbeki","The Government will act to ensure the observance of these laws as part of our common national offensive against all forms of inequality and discrimination, including racial and gender inequality and discrimination as well as discrimination on the basis of disability.  "
"7456",2000,"Mbeki","The recently completed gender audit will help us to carry out this task as will the objectives set out in the Integrated Strategy on Disability.  "
"7457",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker,  The elimination of poverty remains one of the central objectives of the government and the country. "
"7458",2000,"Mbeki","As we are all aware, this poverty is intimately related to the issues of racism and sexism which we have been discussing.  "
"7459",2000,"Mbeki","Its elimination is fundamental to the realisation of the goal of the restoration of the dignity of all our people.  "
"7460",2000,"Mbeki","Accordingly, this places high on our agenda the task of ensuring that all of us act together to achieve high and sustained rates of growth for our economy.  "
"7461",2000,"Mbeki","Once more, we would like to make the point that we have never been better positioned than we are today to achieve the progress we have to attain with regard to this important challenge.  "
"7462",2000,"Mbeki","Many major indicators point to the excellent work that has been done to place our country on a strong growth path. "
"7463",2000,"Mbeki","All indicators also signal that during this year, our economy will register much more vigorous growth than it did last year.  "
"7464",2000,"Mbeki","Of great importance in this regard, indicating the resilience, the effective restructuring and therefore the improved international competitiveness of our economy, was the success we achieved in withstanding the effects of the East Asian economic crisis of the late 1990's.  "
"7465",2000,"Mbeki","Let us now turn to some of the major indicators to which we have referred.  "
"7466",2000,"Mbeki","Whereas the Reuters December 1999 Survey resulted in the highest projected GDP growth rates of 3.5% and 3.7% for the years 2000/and/01 respectively, the January Survey sharply raised these figures to 6.5% for both years.  "
"7467",2000,"Mbeki","We should also compare these figures to average GDP growth achieved in the period 1993-1998, which amounted to 2.7%.  "
"7468",2000,"Mbeki","In 1993 foreign direct investment amounted to R941 million as compared to just under R6.5 billion in 1998, with portfolio investment growing from R2.4 billion to R20.4 billion in the same period.  "
"7469",2000,"Mbeki","Whereas the level of inflation was 12.5% during the period 1990-1994, it had come down to 5.2.% for 1999 and is projected to come down further during this year to 5.0%.  "
"7470",2000,"Mbeki","At the height of the Asian crisis, the interest rate rose to 25.5% but is now currently down to 14.5%.  "
"7471",2000,"Mbeki","Whereas the foreign reserves stood at R32.6 billion in January 1999, as of day before yesterday they had reached R46.4 billion.  "
"7472",2000,"Mbeki","During the period 1990-1994, the budget deficit as a percentage of the GDP averaged out at 6.6%, but had been managed down to 2.9% during the period 1998-1999.  "
"7473",2000,"Mbeki","In the last few days, because of the sound management of our financial system, a major international rating agency ranked South Africa with regard to the potential level of non-performing loans in the same bracket with countries such as Austria, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Spain.  "
"7474",2000,"Mbeki","Similarly, the announcements made again within the last few days concerning investments in the automobile and air transport sectors by major international corporations reflect the confidence of the international business community in our economy and our country.  "
"7475",2000,"Mbeki","These and other developments vindicate the statement made by Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Chairperson of Anglo American PLC, when he spoke in Canada on the 1st of November last year.  "
"7476",2000,"Mbeki","Speaking at the CIBC Wood Grundy Annual Dinner he said:  "" We believe that foreign investors who have been slow in placing direct investment as opposed to portfolio investment will increasingly share our assessment that South Africa is one of the most attractive emerging markets.""  "
"7477",2000,"Mbeki","Our Government fully shares this confidence, which was also communicated to us by all the business leaders with whom we had the privilege to interact at the World Economic Forum at Davos.  "
"7478",2000,"Mbeki","When we spoke at the opening of our second democratic parliament in June, we reported on steps that would be taken further to enhance the partnership between the public and private sectors with a view further to reinforce the growth and development of our economy.  "
"7479",2000,"Mbeki","The four working groups we announced have now been established. "
"7480",2000,"Mbeki","Three of these have already met.  "
"7481",2000,"Mbeki","The four working groups comprise:  Big business; The trade union federations; Black business; and, The agricultural sector.  "
"7482",2000,"Mbeki","Of these only the latter group has not yet convened, owing to time constraints.  "
"7483",2000,"Mbeki","These working groups do not replace NEDLAC but provide the possibility for Government to interact with these various sectors on the steps we should take as a country to achieve economic growth and development and to remove all obstacles that might impede the realisation of this goal.  "
"7484",2000,"Mbeki","I am also pleased to announce that the International Investment Council has also been constituted, except for three or four confirmations we are still expecting, about which, unfortunately, I am not at liberty to give any further details.  "
"7485",2000,"Mbeki","The following constitute the membership of the Council:  Mr William Rhodes, Vice President of the Citigroup Inc. of the United States; Dr George Soros, Chairperson of the Soros Fund Management; Mr Frank Savage, Chairperson of Alliance Capital Management International of the United States; Mr Percy Barnevik, Chairperson of Investor AB of Sweden; Mr Niall FitzGerald, Co-Chairperson of the British-Dutch Unilever; Mr Minoru Makihara, Chairperson of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan; Mr Sam Jonah, CEO of Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana; Dr Tony O'Reilly of the Independent Newspapers of Ireland; Mr Ratan N. "
"7486",2000,"Mbeki","Tata, Group Chairperson of Tata of India; Mr Hassan Marikan, Chairperson of Petronas of Malaysia; Sir Robert Ross, Chairperson of the D-Group of the UK; Mr Martin Kohlhausen, Chairperson of Commerzbank of Germany; and, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, CEO of Daimler-Chrysler.  "
"7487",2000,"Mbeki","We would like to take this opportunity sincerely to thank these eminent international business leaders for their readiness to serve on the International Investment Council as well as their firm and unwavering confidence in our economy and our country.  "
"7488",2000,"Mbeki","We look forward to working with them as the all-weather friends of our country and people that they are.  "
"7489",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Honourable Members,  The Government is committed to the enhancement of the sound macro-economic framework which is fundamental to the accomplishment of our economic goals.  "
"7490",2000,"Mbeki","In this regard, we have already announced that we will be setting inflation targets as one of the measures to ensure this sound framework. "
"7491",2000,"Mbeki","I hereby confirm that we will proceed with this issue as we have indicated. "
"7492",2000,"Mbeki","The Honourable Minister of Finance will address this matter when he presents the budget in 19 days time.  "
"7493",2000,"Mbeki","Driven as we all are by the determination to ensure that our economy continues to expand and transform, I am confident that all our social partners will work with us to achieve the purposes which informed the decision to set inflation targets.  "
"7494",2000,"Mbeki","For some years now, we have maintained the position that we will work continuously towards the removal of the foreign exchange controls we inherited from the apartheid regime.  "
"7495",2000,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we have already removed all foreign exchange controls with regard to foreigners.  "
"7496",2000,"Mbeki","The remaining controls therefore relate only to South Africans. "
"7497",2000,"Mbeki","Again, the Minister of Finance will address this issue when he presents the budget on the 23rd of February.  "
"7498",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker,  The Government is concerned about our low savings ratio and the negative impact this has on our rate of investment.  "
"7499",2000,"Mbeki","We have therefore constituted an inter-ministerial group to work on this important issue.  "
"7500",2000,"Mbeki","After the necessary interaction with our social partners, and later this year, the Government will announce to parliament and the country the steps it proposes should be taken to address this matter.  "
"7501",2000,"Mbeki","Last June, when we presented the State of the Nation Address, we said that an area that had ""attracted considerable comment is the labour market and its actual or perceived impact on investment and job creation.""  "
"7502",2000,"Mbeki","We went on to say that ""The Government will continue to give priority to the issue of job creation. "
"7503",2000,"Mbeki","If perceptions or realities influence the process negatively, these must be addressed.""  "
"7504",2000,"Mbeki","Consistent with these observations, the Honourable Minister of Labour has led a review of the labour market legislative framework. "
"7505",2000,"Mbeki","This has included interaction with our social partners at NEDLAC.  "
"7506",2000,"Mbeki","As a result of this review, the Government has concluded that certain aspects of the legislative instruments aimed at giving effect to our labour market policies have led to unintended consequences.  "
"7507",2000,"Mbeki","For this reason, to ensure that we address simultaneously such issues as fair labour standards and the fostering of economic growth and job creation, amendments to certain provisions of the Labour Relations Act, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Insolvency Act will be introduced this year.  "
"7508",2000,"Mbeki","The Minister of Labour will provide the details of the areas identified for legislative review.  "
"7509",2000,"Mbeki","The Government is also concerned to improve the level and effectiveness of investment by the Government itself. "
"7510",2000,"Mbeki","This includes capital expenditures directed at encouraging the growth of small, micro and medium enterprises.  "
"7511",2000,"Mbeki","We have therefore carried out a comprehensive review of Khula and Ntsika to ensure that they discharge their responsibility to give financial and other support to small and medium business.  "
"7512",2000,"Mbeki","This, coupled with other measures, should enable us to speed up the growth of this sector of our economy, with a positive impact on employment creation, among other things.  "
"7513",2000,"Mbeki","Work is also going on to address the issue of micro-lending especially as this relates to lending for productive economic purposes. "
"7514",2000,"Mbeki","This is especially relevant to the issue of the alleviation and elimination of poverty which continues to afflict millions of our people in both rural and urban areas.  "
"7515",2000,"Mbeki","As part of the process of encouraging economic growth and development, we have also established the Local Economic Development Fund to support municipalities as they work to meet their mandate of stimulating economic development at the local level.  "
"7516",2000,"Mbeki","The Fund has already started to make its disbursements, thus helping to give hope and incomes to people who are unemployed in both urban and rural areas.  "
"7517",2000,"Mbeki","Improvements are also being effected with regard to our Public Works Community Programmes. "
"7518",2000,"Mbeki","These programmes will focus in particular on such infrastructure as rural roads, which are of critical importance to the success of our rural development strategy to which we will refer later.  "
"7519",2000,"Mbeki","Our activities will also continue to focus on the important issue of the deracialisation of our economy, and therefore the encouragement of black economic empowerment.  "
"7520",2000,"Mbeki","The working group with black business will facilitate this process, including the consideration of the reports prepared by the Government and the Black Economic Empowerment Commission respectively.  "
"7521",2000,"Mbeki","At the same time, the Government will continue with its work to improve our infrastructure.  "
"7522",2000,"Mbeki","Of particular importance in this regard will be the activities of such state corporations as Transnet, Eskom, Telkom as well as the Roads Agency and the Municipal Infrastructure Investment Programme with regard to the expansion and the improvement of our transport, electricity and telecommunications infrastructures.  "
"7523",2000,"Mbeki","The programme for the restructuring of state assets is also being speeded up to address these objectives, to increase the levels of investment and further to modernise the economy.  "
"7524",2000,"Mbeki","During this year we will pay particular attention to the Transnet Group to continue the process of change represented by the acquisition of a valuable strategic partner by South African Airways last year.  "
"7525",2000,"Mbeki","Of especial importance will be our capacity to ensure that the cost structure of our transport network is consistent with the high and sustained growth rates we have to achieve.  "
"7526",2000,"Mbeki","Consistent with the decisions taken at the Jobs Summit, both the public and the private sectors have committed the necessary funds for the promotion of the tourism sector, commonly accepted as potentially one of the most important sectors with regard to job creation.  "
"7527",2000,"Mbeki","The work has therefore begun vigorously to promote the growth of this sector. "
"7528",2000,"Mbeki","We are certain this will produce the necessary beneficial results.  "
"7529",2000,"Mbeki","While we were at Davos, I received a letter from Professors Nicholas Conard and John Parkington of the Universities of Tubingen and Cape Town respectively.  "
"7530",2000,"Mbeki","They make the important observation that:  "" The archaeological record of South Africa, including human fossils, artefacts and organic remains, has an international significance that extends far beyond the country's borders...("
"7531",2000,"Mbeki","Less well known) are the hominids that demonstrate the earliest signs of modern people and the treasure trove of rock art sites.""  "
"7532",2000,"Mbeki","While correctly pointing to the need to protect this heritage, to which we must surely respond, they also indicate the potential for job creation in the preservation and other activities at the various archaeological sites.  "
"7533",2000,"Mbeki","Needless to say, these can also be powerful tourist attractions, thus emphasising the importance raised by the two professors with regard to the challenge of looking after what we have inherited which is as old as the origins of humanity.  "
"7534",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Honourable Members,  As we have indicated would be done when we opened the new parliament last June, the Government has carried out extensive and intensive work to elaborate an Integrated and Sustainable Rural Development Programme.  "
"7535",2000,"Mbeki","The implementation of this Programme will begin this year. "
"7536",2000,"Mbeki","The strategic objective we will pursue will be to ensure that we achieve integrated and sustainable development in our rural areas outside of and in addition to the commercial farms by the Year 2010.  "
"7537",2000,"Mbeki","We chose to focus on these areas to reverse a century-old legacy of white minority rule, according to which millions of our people were confined in poverty-stricken areas alternatively described as native reserves, bantustans and homelands.  "
"7538",2000,"Mbeki","The Honourable Deputy President and Leader of Government Business will provide the details on this matter.  "
"7539",2000,"Mbeki","Last June, I made specific reference to our commitment to deal with the relationship between poverty and crime. "
"7540",2000,"Mbeki","Accordingly, the Government has been working to address the multi-faceted crime and poverty challenges thrown up by the urban areas we identified.  "
"7541",2000,"Mbeki","Time will not allow us to detail the varied work that is being done in these areas. "
"7542",2000,"Mbeki","An opportunity will therefore have to be found in future to present that detailed report.  "
"7543",2000,"Mbeki","At this stage, suffice it for me to say that these areas of high population density will be at the centre of our Urban Renewal Programme. "
"7544",2000,"Mbeki","This is particularly important in the light of the fact that, in reality, the urban areas contain the largest concentrations of poverty in our country.  "
"7545",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker,  I would like to take this opportunity once more to emphasise the importance we attach to the strategic objective of building the partnership between the public and the private sectors.  "
"7546",2000,"Mbeki","We will therefore further intensify our links and co-operation with the private sector for the successful implementation of the various economic initiatives we have mentioned.  "
"7547",2000,"Mbeki","Similarly, we are very encouraged by the response of our people as a whole that we should transform ourselves into a nation at work.  "
"7548",2000,"Mbeki","Throughout the country, from the wine farms in the Western Cape to rural communities in the Northern Province, the people are responding to this call by taking the initiative to engage the challenge of productive economic activity.  "
"7549",2000,"Mbeki","The Government will work further to encourage its partnership with the people for development, which will help to lay to rest the false notion that the Government has the exclusive responsibility to create jobs and therefore that everybody should wait for the Government to create these jobs.  "
"7550",2000,"Mbeki","In this context we must warn very strongly that illegal and unjustified strikes such as the one recently experienced at Volkswagen in Uitenhage cannot be tolerated.  "
"7551",2000,"Mbeki","Jobs, a better life for our people in the context of a growing economy and our standing in the eyes of the international investor community and the national investor community cannot be held hostage by elements pursuing selfish and anti-social purposes.  "
"7552",2000,"Mbeki","Accordingly, the Government has worked with the management at Volkswagen as well as NUMSA to ensure that the problem created by some irresponsible elements at this plant is resolved. "
"7553",2000,"Mbeki","The Government will not waver from this position.  "
"7554",2000,"Mbeki","In this context, I must also make this clear that the Government is determined to carry out the programme for the renewal of our minibus taxi fleet as well as the introduction of other measures to ensure that this sector provides a safe, dependable and disciplined service to the public.  "
"7555",2000,"Mbeki","Ageing minibuses which were designed as family vehicles cannot be allowed to roam our roads condemning paying passengers to risk their lives by travelling in mobile coffins.  "
"7556",2000,"Mbeki","As some of our provincial governments demonstrated when they closed down taxi ranks to deal with the continuing problem of taxi violence, and while we are ready to engage in genuine consultations, it is a mistake to think that the government can be intimidated into taking wrong decisions.  "
"7557",2000,"Mbeki","Here, we would also like to make the point that low tax morality has led to an increase in tax criminality. "
"7558",2000,"Mbeki","The Revenue Service will therefore introduce new measures which will result in tough action against non-compliant tax payers, who defraud the fiscus of millions of Rand through VAT and Customs fraud, tax evasion or not registering for tax at all.  "
"7559",2000,"Mbeki","Tax criminality feeds other forms of criminality and will also not be tolerated.  "
"7560",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker,  We are certain that the combination of the various economic initiatives and processes we have mentioned, including the continuing implementation of all the commitments made at the Job Summit, will take us further forward as we address the ever urgent questions of economic growth, development, job creation and poverty reduction.  "
"7561",2000,"Mbeki","In this regard, we must also mention our hope that the European Union will overcome the problems that have arisen within its ranks which have affected the unhindered implementation of the Trade and Development Agreement which was concluded between ourselves and the EU.  "
"7562",2000,"Mbeki","Similarly, we continue to work hard to conclude the matters relating largely to the issue of rules of origin, which have delayed the implementation of the SADC Trade Protocol.  "
"7563",2000,"Mbeki","We remain convinced that this Protocol will come into force during the first half of this year, signifying a critically important step forward towards the transformation of our region into a common economic area.  "
"7564",2000,"Mbeki","At the same time, we will continue purposefully and systematically to increase our economic relations with countries of the South for the mutual benefit, including Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, India, Malaysia and China.  "
"7565",2000,"Mbeki","As the Honourable Members are aware, all these matters are of great importance to the success of our economy and will therefore receive the necessary attention.  "
"7566",2000,"Mbeki","Also receiving similar attention is the problem represented by the fact that we still have not removed the bottlenecks which result in a slow disbursement of funds allocated for poverty relief.  "
"7567",2000,"Mbeki","The Government has determined that this is unacceptable, while recognising that it reflects the fact that we have not yet completed the work of the fundamental restructuring of our system of governance.  "
"7568",2000,"Mbeki","These poverty relief funds represent an important part of our social expenditure, which continues to be focused on meeting the social needs of the most disadvantaged in our society.  "
"7569",2000,"Mbeki","The Government will continue to allocate significant resources to address these needs as best we can.  "
"7570",2000,"Mbeki","We will therefore continue with our programmes to address such matters as pensions and social welfare, housing, education and medical care.  "
"7571",2000,"Mbeki","At the same time, we are working towards the creation of an integrated social security system further to improve the quality of our social spending and to enhance its positive impact on those in our society who are most in need.  "
"7572",2000,"Mbeki","It is however also clear that we need to strike the proper balance between such expenditure and more directly economic expenditure by the public sector, to ensure that we address the challenges of growth and redistribution together. "
"7573",2000,"Mbeki","This also is being attended to.  "
"7574",2000,"Mbeki","Later this year, at the beginning of July, our country will host the 13th International AIDS Conference. "
"7575",2000,"Mbeki","This will help further to focus our attention on this important challenge.  "
"7576",2000,"Mbeki","As we announced when we spoke at the NCOP last year, the Honourable Minister of Health continues to address the complex questions which relate to the issue of AIDS.  "
"7577",2000,"Mbeki","What seems to be clear, as of now, is that in addition to the work that is being done and which must be intensified, regarding the sexual behaviour of our people and the use of condoms, all possible interventions will have to be made to deal with the challenges of poverty and malnutrition, a whole range of well known diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis and others, as well as the development of the required vaccines.  "
"7578",2000,"Mbeki","It is necessary that we further strengthen our Partnerships Against AIDS to ensure that the anti-AIDS message reaches all our people. "
"7579",2000,"Mbeki","I would also like to take this opportunity to wish the National AIDS Council success in its work.  "
"7580",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker,  Of great importance to our successful development is the matter of Human Resource Development. "
"7581",2000,"Mbeki","Both the Skills Levy and the Umsobomvu Fund will be used to help us to deal with this matter.  "
"7582",2000,"Mbeki","The Tirisano programme launched by the Honourable Minister of Education also constitutes an important plank in our offensive to ensure that we develop the necessary levels of education and training.  "
"7583",2000,"Mbeki","In particular, this year, we will pay special attention to the improvement of the quality of the management of our schools with the intention to ensure that we really reinculcate the culture of learning, teaching and discipline throughout our school system.  "
"7584",2000,"Mbeki","Two days ago I had the privilege to participate at the celebration of the success achieved by a group of Soweto high school students who obtained their matriculation exemptions.  "
"7585",2000,"Mbeki","What was remarkable about this group is that both their parents and their teachers had given them up because of their involvement in crime and other deviant behaviour.  "
"7586",2000,"Mbeki","Nevertheless two outstanding South Africans, Mrs Jacky Maarohanye, who participated in the Soweto Uprising of 1976 and Dr T. "
"7587",2000,"Mbeki","W. "
"7588",2000,"Mbeki","Kambule, an old and distinguished teacher and principal now aged 79, decided to act as parent and teacher to these young people.  "
"7589",2000,"Mbeki","Through the work of their Ithuteng Trust, we now have 1 500 Soweto youth who not only study hard but also carry out important voluntary community work, including educating their peers to turn against crime, against rape and against drug abuse.  "
"7590",2000,"Mbeki","We have to inspire all our schools to emulate the example of the Ithuteng Trust which can truly be described as an outstanding example of the South African miracle.  "
"7591",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker:  When we addressed parliament at the end of June last year, we made a commitment to step up the fight against crime. "
"7592",2000,"Mbeki","This we have done and will continue further to intensify our offensive.  "
"7593",2000,"Mbeki","Among other things, this involves the restructuring and revamping of our entire criminal justice system. "
"7594",2000,"Mbeki","This work is also proceeding apace and includes the improvement of our capacity effectively to deal with the crimes of rape and the abuse of women, children and the disabled.  "
"7595",2000,"Mbeki","Similarly, we will not relax our efforts to root out corruption in our society, with special focus on the public sector.  "
"7596",2000,"Mbeki","The Honourable Ministers heading the criminal justice system, including the Ministers of Home Affairs and Defence, will have occasion to report on the important work they are doing severally and collectively within the context of our National Crime Prevention Strategy.  "
"7597",2000,"Mbeki","We are still faced with the task of completing the process of the restructuring of the machinery of government. "
"7598",2000,"Mbeki","Among the objectives we are pursuing are:  * the raising of the skills levels within the public sector and retaining professional personnel;  * improving management, financial accountability and service delivery;  * combating corruption and the abuse of public resources;  * enhancing the motivation of all public sector workers to serve our people and,  * increasing the proportion of public funds spent on investment.  "
"7599",2000,"Mbeki","Additional steps will therefore be taken this year to ensure the right-sizing of our public service.  "
"7600",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker,  This year we will be holding our second local government elections. "
"7601",2000,"Mbeki","We are confident that once again, we will all work together to ensure that these elections are held in conditions of peace and peaceful political competition and that they are free and fair.  "
"7602",2000,"Mbeki","We will appeal once more to members of the public service and our population at large to volunteer their services to assist the Independent Electoral Commission to carry out its tasks as effectively as it accomplished the task of organising and conducting the last general election.  "
"7603",2000,"Mbeki","I am also convinced that we will also succeed to remove the misconceptions that have arisen with regard to the local government Demarcation process.  "
"7604",2000,"Mbeki","This relates in particular to issues relating to communal areas and the constitutionally guaranteed place and role of the traditional leaders and the traditional institutions of government.  "
"7605",2000,"Mbeki","Once again, I would like to assure our traditional leaders, whose representatives around our country I will see during the coming weeks, that the demarcation process bears no relationship whatsoever to, and has no negative impact on, their role and powers.  "
"7606",2000,"Mbeki","Accordingly, we will still rely on them to continue to mobilise the people they represent to participate in the processes of the further entrenchment of democracy and the enhancement of development in the rural areas.  "
"7607",2000,"Mbeki","Madame Speaker and Honourable Members,  When we spoke from this podium at the Millennium Debate last year, we urged that we should use this year to prepare for the launch of the African Century.  "
"7608",2000,"Mbeki","Specifically, we said that:  "" we should devote the Year 2000 that is upon us, to do everything that needs to be done to ensure that by its end, we see our entire Continent at the ready to join in a powerful movement of the peoples of Africa for the realisation of Africa's century.""  "
"7609",2000,"Mbeki","The Government is committed to this goal and will do everything it can to ensure that it is realised. "
"7610",2000,"Mbeki","We also call on all our people in their various formations to respond to our call.  "
"7611",2000,"Mbeki","The Government pledges its full support both to Nelson Mandela and Sir Ketumile Masire of Botswana as they work with the governments and people of Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo to bring peace and democracy to these sister African countries.  "
"7612",2000,"Mbeki","I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate our Honourable Minister of Trade and Industry for the work he has done in the last three years as President of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, an international post he will relinquish soon.  "
"7613",2000,"Mbeki","Many around the world, including our own people, will continue to rely on the Honourable Minister of Trade and Industry to defend the interests of the poor of the world within the forthcoming World Trade Organisation negotiations.  "
"7614",2000,"Mbeki","We will ourselves continue to do our best to discharge our responsibilities as current chairperson of both the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth.  "
"7615",2000,"Mbeki","As much as the rest of the world stood with us as we fought to end the system of apartheid, which struggle brought about the announcements that were made from this rostrum as the apartheid parliament opened 10 years ago, so do we have an obligation ourselves to contribute to the construction of a better world for all humanity.  "
"7616",2000,"Mbeki","From this, we cannot walk away.  "
"7617",2000,"Mbeki","We should aim to make a meaningful contribution in this regard because with regard to all the important objectives we have to pursue, at no point during our entire history have we ever been as well placed as we are today to meet the challenges that confront us.  "
"7618",2000,"Mbeki","Our national soccer team, Bafana Bafana, is in West Africa participating in the African Cup of Nations tournament. "
"7619",2000,"Mbeki","We wish them well in their campaign, convinced that once more they will return with the Africa Cup.  "
"7620",2000,"Mbeki","At the same time, it is clear that fairness and the development of soccer, this most popular world sport, demand that, for the first time in the Year 2006, the Soccer World Cup competition should take place in Africa.  "
"7621",2000,"Mbeki","For these purposes, there can be no better venue than the land of human hope, that has all the necessary facilities, which our country is. "
"7622",2000,"Mbeki","One among us, who sits on the back benches of the majority party, has composed a ""Freedom Lament and Song"".  "
"7623",2000,"Mbeki","In his lament, he says of the men and women that constitute humanity that:  "" they are of spirit which is like the wind mind them when you touch them when you hurt them when you kill them when you are unkind to them when you are cruel to them mind them they will live in you and you in them like a story which does not end...""  "
"7624",2000,"Mbeki","It is out of these noble feelings that our own new world will be born, whose sighting, perhaps at a distance, has inspired the spirit of hope which reigns so confidently in all corners of our beautiful land.  "
"7625",2000,"Mbeki","His name is Mongane Wally Serote, poet, patriot and Member of Parliament.  "
"7626",2000,"Mbeki","I thank you for your attention"
"7627",1999,"Mandela"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly; Honourable Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons of the National Council of Provinces; Honourable Members of Parliament; Distinguished guests; ladies and Gentlemen:  Today we start the ultimate session of our first democratic parliament.  "
"7628",1999,"Mandela","The profound changes of the past four-and-half years make the distance traversed seem so short; the end so sudden. "
"7629",1999,"Mandela","Yet with the epoch-making progress that has been made, this period could have been decades.  "
"7630",1999,"Mandela","South Africa is in a momentous process of change, blazing a trail towards a secure future.  "
"7631",1999,"Mandela","The time is yet to come for farewells, as many of us - by choice or circumstance - will not return.  "
"7632",1999,"Mandela","However, there is no time to pause. "
"7633",1999,"Mandela","The long walk is not yet over. "
"7634",1999,"Mandela","The prize of a better life has yet to be won  Allow me, Madame Speaker, to cast my eyes further back than the period under review. "
"7635",1999,"Mandela","Ten years ago, in a letter to the Head of the Apartheid State, in an attempt to launch negotiations, one humble prisoner said that, at a first meeting between government and the ANC, two central issues needed to be addressed:  "" .. .firstly, the demand for majority rule in a unitary state; secondly, the concern of white South Africans over this demand, as well as the insistence of whites on structural guarantees that majority rule will not mean domination of the white minority by blacks""  In yet another letter, it was emphasised:  ""The very first step on the way to reconciliation is obviously the dismantling of apartheid, and all measures used to reinforce it. "
"7636",1999,"Mandela","To talk of reconciliation before this major step is taken is totally unrealistic""  These are some of the matters that I will address today.  "
"7637",1999,"Mandela","Our transition has been managed with such success that some generously invoke the imagery of ""miracle"". "
"7638",1999,"Mandela","Things such as equality, the right to vote in free and fair elections and freedom of speech, many of us now take for granted. "
"7639",1999,"Mandela","Many past difficulties are now mere footnotes of history.  "
"7640",1999,"Mandela","There can be no equivocation that the majority of South Africans, coalesced around our founding pact, are outgrowing the apprehensions which required the convoluted ""structural guarantees"" of the first few years. "
"7641",1999,"Mandela","Though we might differ on method, it has become a national passion to pronounce commitment to a better life for all.  "
"7642",1999,"Mandela","What then is the nation's scorecard on the fundamental question of socio-economic change?  "
"7643",1999,"Mandela","Census 96, whose result was made public last year, has for the first time given South Africa a detailed and comprehensive portrait of itself. "
"7644",1999,"Mandela","And it is against its dimensions that we must measure our progress.  "
"7645",1999,"Mandela","In 1994, some 30% of South Africans lacked access to a safe supply of water near their homes: today, after three million people have benefited from the government's water supply programme, that has been reduced to 20%.  "
"7646",1999,"Mandela","In 1994, less than 40% of South African households had electricity: today, after more than 2 million connections, 63% of households are connected to the electricity grid. "
"7647",1999,"Mandela","In 1DS4, about a quarter of homes had telephones: today, after 1.3-million have been connected, 35% are linked to the telephone system.  "
"7648",1999,"Mandela","This means that every day on average since our democratic elections has meant another 1,300 homes electrified; another 750 telephones installed; and another 1,700 people gaining access to clean water.. . "
"7649",1999,"Mandela","Every day! "
"7650",1999,"Mandela","With the primary school nutrition programme reaching over 5-million children and the benefit of free health care, millions of children are growing healthy and unstunted.  "
"7651",1999,"Mandela","Within the framework of our Integrated National Disability Strategy, today we have a government whose concern for the needs of the disabled is unprecedented in the history of South Africa.  "
"7652",1999,"Mandela","This means more than the dry rhyme of statistics. "
"7653",1999,"Mandela","The words of Ms Gladys Nzilane of Evaton who received keys to her new house last year ring true from the heart:  ""I hear people on radio and television saying the government has failed; but I do not believe that....["
"7654",1999,"Mandela","This government] has given us life"".  "
"7655",1999,"Mandela","In this, she was echoing the feelings of millions, including Mama Lenah Ntsweni of Mpumalanga who was the 3-rnillionth person to receive safe and accessible water a few weeks ago.  "
"7656",1999,"Mandela","Before we lose ourselves in detail, important though it may be, let us come back to the trends. "
"7657",1999,"Mandela","The critical question is about a machinery which is improving its capacity to meet the needs of South Africans.  "
"7658",1999,"Mandela","Even where we might not have met our targets, this is the question that we need to probe.  "
"7659",1999,"Mandela","Such is the experience in the provision of subsidised housing. "
"7660",1999,"Mandela","With 700-thousand houses either built or under construction, we do acknowledge that we shall not reach the target of one million that we set ourselves. "
"7661",1999,"Mandela","But, after the initial hiccups of the first two years, we have now developed the capacity to build 15,000 houses every month.  "
"7662",1999,"Mandela","From the Jobs Summit, new initiatives have emerged, in a splendid partnership between business and government, to start major projects that will put more roofs over the head of those in want. "
"7663",1999,"Mandela","As this project starts unlocking the problem of limited public resources, so will its beneficiaries multiply - from the supplier of building material to the small building contractor, from the new employees to those who will occupy these dwellings.  "
"7664",1999,"Mandela","The construction of sports facilities reached new levels in 1998 and the establishment of Community Arts Centres exceeded the target. "
"7665",1999,"Mandela","New ways of facilitating land restitution and redistribution are being implemented. "
"7666",1999,"Mandela","The Adult Basic Education and Training Programme has reached more people than was originally planned.  "
"7667",1999,"Mandela","In the area of welfare, after the pain of restructuring, the reach and the efficiency of delivery has improved; and R350-million is being saved a year by better management and eliminating corruption.  "
"7668",1999,"Mandela","The examples are many. "
"7669",1999,"Mandela","But let us focus for a brief moment on two of the issues, namely welfare and education. "
"7670",1999,"Mandela","The savings that have been effected through tackling fraud should rightly contribute to an expansion of assistance to those in need. "
"7671",1999,"Mandela","During this Year of Older Persons, all of us - and I do include myself - are especially aware of the needs of senior citizens. "
"7672",1999,"Mandela","We are therefore pleased to announce that we are able once again to increase old age pensions - this year by 4%, that is R20; and the disability grant by the same percentage.  "
"7673",1999,"Mandela","Regarding education, why is it that the majority of South Africans feel that things have improved in this area?  "
"7674",1999,"Mandela","This is because many of those who were studying under trees or in dilapidated buildings have benefited from the R1-billion spent on the construction or renovation of 10,000 classrooms.  "
"7675",1999,"Mandela","It is because the doors of all public schools are open; it is because the higher education assistance scheme is reaching more students; it is because, despite the setbacks of one or another year, the Matric results are improving. "
"7676",1999,"Mandela","And even if this majority does not read or hear or see in the media the praise that is due when the Matric examinations are conducted without a major incident, they do not need to be told, for they live these experiences.  "
"7677",1999,"Mandela","Last year, we made the observation that it was inexcusable that text-books were not supplied within seven days of the beginning of the school-term: Many areas did meet this target. "
"7678",1999,"Mandela","However, many did not. "
"7679",1999,"Mandela","We hope that this year the planning and funding will be settled earlier in the year. "
"7680",1999,"Mandela","For, if this does not happen after the pressured experiences of last year; if our administrations are unable to carry out such a straight-forward project; then in the coming year, ordinary citizens like myself, will feel justified in calling, so to speak, for heads to roll!  "
"7681",1999,"Mandela","Honourable Members and Delegates;  What this experience with text-books says to us is that capacity cannot be built through ordinary motions of government as we know it. "
"7682",1999,"Mandela","I know Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has taken this issue to heart: that is, how to restructure government with the prime objective of fulfilling people-centred functions, rather than merely observing self-serving and archaic rules.  "
"7683",1999,"Mandela","Such is the challenge in dealing with the difficult areas of crime and job-creation. "
"7684",1999,"Mandela","On both these issues there is naturally public impatience. "
"7685",1999,"Mandela","So the question we need to ask is whether there is a possibility of a strategic and visible break with the perception of stagnation!  "
"7686",1999,"Mandela","It is not my task, at this last sitting of Parliament, to set out medium- and long-term programmes. "
"7687",1999,"Mandela","But I feel more than confident to say that on both counts - with regard to crime and job-creation - there is hope.  "
"7688",1999,"Mandela","What are the trends and concrete measures on crime?  "
"7689",1999,"Mandela","The statistics show that there has been a reduction or stabilisation in most serious crimes. "
"7690",1999,"Mandela","Murder for instance has declined by 10% since 1994. "
"7691",1999,"Mandela","But the response is made that figures are meaningless in the context of people's concrete experiences.  "
"7692",1999,"Mandela","A myriad of laws have been passed to narrow the space for criminals, the latest among these being legislation on crime syndicates as well as minimum sentences and conditions on the granting of bail. "
"7693",1999,"Mandela","But the response is that not enough criminals are being arrested and the quality of investigation is poor.  "
"7694",1999,"Mandela","A detective academy has been set up, and the skills gathered here are starting to be felt in dealing with crime syndicates. "
"7695",1999,"Mandela","And major steps have been taken to deploy police where they are needed most. "
"7696",1999,"Mandela","But the response is, where are the results!  "
"7697",1999,"Mandela","All these responses arise from a failure to appreciate the fact that turning the tide against crime cannot be achieved overnight. "
"7698",1999,"Mandela","There are also deliberate efforts to sensationalise and politicise this issue. "
"7699",1999,"Mandela","But we are the first to acknowledge that the impatience and dissatisfaction among ordinary people are justified.  "
"7700",1999,"Mandela","We can and shall break out of this bog. "
"7701",1999,"Mandela","There is hope.  "
"7702",1999,"Mandela","Examine the experience of the Johannesburg central precinct and the Durban beach-front where communities and business-people have joined with police and cut the crime rate, and you will know there is hope. "
"7703",1999,"Mandela","Ask the kingpins of cash-in-transit heists who are in C-max and you will know there is hope. "
"7704",1999,"Mandela","Ask the corrupt police who are facing various charges, and you will know there is hope. "
"7705",1999,"Mandela","Even though the level of attacks is rather too high, assess the trends in farming communities after the Summit on this issue and you will know there is hope.  "
"7706",1999,"Mandela","For this we salute the men and women in blue, the overwhelming majority of them citizens of outstanding bravery and integrity; men and women who daily put their lives on the line so that the nation can enjoy security.  "
"7707",1999,"Mandela","Above all, the establishment of the Office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions and, along with it, the special investigation unit, has already shown that a systematic approach to major crimes - combining intelligence, professional investigations and prosecutions - is bound to bear fruit. "
"7708",1999,"Mandela","And in expressing our appreciation to the intelligence services for their contribution in this and other areas to guarantee our people's security, I wish to join the public in saying: more can be done; and more must be done.  "
"7709",1999,"Mandela","Questions have been asked whether we have got the balance right between the rights of criminals and those of ordinary citizens. "
"7710",1999,"Mandela","This government is not about to join the chorus baying for the death sentence or to reverse our human rights gains. "
"7711",1999,"Mandela","Yet, in addition to the measures we introduced regarding bail and mandatory sentences we need to examine spaces that need tightening.  "
"7712",1999,"Mandela","For instance, should interference with witnesses and murder of police-men and women not attract very harsh mandatory sentences? "
"7713",1999,"Mandela","What about the form and content of evidence that should be given to defence attorneys in bail applications? "
"7714",1999,"Mandela","For it does not help for the police to do their work and for the justice system to be efficient, if criminals will subvert investigations and prosecution by violent and foul means.  "
"7715",1999,"Mandela","These are just some of the issues that need to be addressed, along with, and I should underline, ""along with"" the plodding industry on all fronts which will take many years, to bring crime down to acceptable levels.  "
"7716",1999,"Mandela","Let me also briefly reflect on recent developments in Cape Town. "
"7717",1999,"Mandela","Without presuming any organisation or individual guilty, there are some obvious things that cannot be concealed.  "
"7718",1999,"Mandela","Firstly, what started off expressly as a campaign against gangsterism has now become a violent and murderous offensive against ordinary citizens and law-enforcement agencies. "
"7719",1999,"Mandela","Secondly, what is portrayed as moral and god-inspired against oppression, exploitation and imperialism, has assumed the form of terrorism to undercut Cape Town's lifeline and destabilise a democratic government. "
"7720",1999,"Mandela","Thirdly, what is undertaken as an expression of militancy, could now very easily provide cover for right-wing counter-revolution against the new South Africa.  "
"7721",1999,"Mandela","This campaign is rotten to the core; it is misguided; and its attempts to invoke religion is blasphemous. "
"7722",1999,"Mandela","What South African indeed who owes loyalty to this country and this continent, would engage in such callous deeds! "
"7723",1999,"Mandela","What fighter against crime would engage in a campaign that diverts resources of the police from dealing with criminals!  "
"7724",1999,"Mandela","I want to assure the people of Cape Town that we know who these people are; we know who trains and backs them; and steadily we are building water-tight cases against them that will ensure that they stay in jail for a long, long time.  "
"7725",1999,"Mandela","Let me reiterate: the battle against crime has been joined. "
"7726",1999,"Mandela","And we have no doubts at all about who the victors will be.  "
"7727",1999,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  There is hope too in the area of job-creation.  "
"7728",1999,"Mandela","For a start, if economic growth last year and this year are less encouraging, we are confident that this is an exception that confirms an otherwise upward trend. "
"7729",1999,"Mandela","Indeed, in this era of volatility, what we need to ask ourselves is why South Africa did not experience the kind of paralysing turbulence that was the lot of most countries at our level of development.  "
"7730",1999,"Mandela","The answer is that our fundamentals are robust. "
"7731",1999,"Mandela","Local and foreign fixed investments are on the rise, though not at the pace we would prefer. "
"7732",1999,"Mandela","Exports are increasing; and in some areas of agriculture for instance, the increase has been by as much as 1,000%.  "
"7733",1999,"Mandela","Steadily, our economy is becoming more competitive. "
"7734",1999,"Mandela","Telecommunications and tourism are growing at an impressive rate; road construction and Spatial Development Initiatives are expanding the economic base of regions that were ignored in the past; public works programmes have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, though some of them are temporary.  "
"7735",1999,"Mandela","We have also taken impressive strides in the restructuring of state assets. "
"7736",1999,"Mandela","And let us remind ourselves that some of the successes in the provision of services derive directly from this. "
"7737",1999,"Mandela","We are determined to continue with this programme; but to do it in a way that is systematic and professional, and benefits the people as a whole. "
"7738",1999,"Mandela","This includes widening the base of ownership, among others, through the National Empowerment Fund.  "
"7739",1999,"Mandela","South Africa did not experience what others did because we have credible and sustainable fiscal and monetary policies combining discipline and flexibility. "
"7740",1999,"Mandela","Despite the difficulties that we have experienced, deriving from the global economy, we have resolved that we shall not cut the social spending required to build a better life for all, including the Poverty Relief Programme that now runs into billions of rands.  "
"7741",1999,"Mandela","While strict econometric models may require certain fractions for a balance among indicators, we shall continue to discuss realistic inflation targets and interest rates for a developing country like ours;.  "
"7742",1999,"Mandela","We shall not divert from the course of discipline; nor shall we, as we said last year, cut our noses in order to spite our faces.  "
"7743",1999,"Mandela","Yet the public is within its rights to ask, if all is well, why is the economy shedding jobs: is there hope?  "
"7744",1999,"Mandela","Yes there is hope.  "
"7745",1999,"Mandela","Many of the initiatives will take time to be felt in the lives of ordinary people. "
"7746",1999,"Mandela","But there are immediate things that can be done.  "
"7747",1999,"Mandela","It was in recognition of this challenge, that representatives of government, labour, business and communities came together last October to work out a concrete programme of action around this challenge of job-creation. "
"7748",1999,"Mandela","And we emerged from there confident of the future because we set out to build it together. "
"7749",1999,"Mandela","Among the decisions taken there, some of them unprecedented in any country, are:  � Firstly, the proposal of the trade union movement to mobilise all working people to dedicate one day's pay to the projects meant to create jobs for our fellow citizens. "
"7750",1999,"Mandela","And today I commit all ministers and deputy ministers in my government to take part in this initiative by contributing a day's gross salary. "
"7751",1999,"Mandela","We hope that all levels of government, including parliament as well as public and private institutions will do the same. "
"7752",1999,"Mandela","� Secondly, the mobilisation by the business community of funds which should run into more than R1-billion for special projects in tourism and skills development. "
"7753",1999,"Mandela","We can take tourism beyond the impressive 8.2% of Gross Domestic Product that it has already achieved, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. "
"7754",1999,"Mandela","� Over the next few years, there will be a dramatic expansion of the existing R5billion government package of labour intensive programmes such as Working for Water, Land Care, Municipal Infrastructure and selected Welfare projects. "
"7755",1999,"Mandela","� One major project on housing has already started, where public and private funds will be pooled to start a process that will speed up housing delivery at the same time as it creates jobs. "
"7756",1999,"Mandela","� The Umsobomvu Trust, which will be worth over a billion rand, and which is aimed at creating jobs, learnerships and business opportunities among the youth is one among projects many of which have been proposed by the youth themselves.  "
"7757",1999,"Mandela","Together these major initiatives have the potential to change the face of South Africa. "
"7758",1999,"Mandela","And if we say there is hope, in so far as job-creation is concerned, it is because we know that all the partners have put shoulders to the wheel to ensure that we succeed.  "
"7759",1999,"Mandela","In this context, we should reflect on our achievements regarding the regulation of the labour market. "
"7760",1999,"Mandela","I refer here to the Labour Relations, Basic Conditions of Employment and Employment Equity Acts among others. "
"7761",1999,"Mandela","Liberation could not have meant otherwise to a working class that was divided by racial laws and sections of which were blocked by edict from advancing in the work-place.  "
"7762",1999,"Mandela","We cannot retreat from this achievement in human rights. "
"7763",1999,"Mandela","That our trade union movement has initiated the kind of contribution to job-creation that I referred to, is testimony to the responsibility that goes with a sense of social belonging.  "
"7764",1999,"Mandela","Notwithstanding these achievements, if indeed job-creation and ending poverty are among our primary challenges, we must continually evaluate how our labour market policies and the rate of private investments, among others, facilitate the realisation of these objectives. "
"7765",1999,"Mandela","This we must do in order to ensure that we achieve our common objectives.  "
"7766",1999,"Mandela","This hope that we have about the future, Honourable Members and Delegates, derives also from the knowledge that this government is serious about utilising state structures for the benefit of the people. "
"7767",1999,"Mandela","And this applies not only to the national sphere.  if in the past, the profile of provincial government was portrayed more in the mistakes they made; it is perhaps a reflection of great improvement in their work, in the context of South Africa's news content, that little is heard about most of them in the media.  "
"7768",1999,"Mandela","We referred earlier to management of the Matric results, some improvement in the supply of text-books, and the management of social security grants. "
"7769",1999,"Mandela","In addition to all this, shouldn't we all be proud as South Africans that only two years after the introduction of mass allocations of funds to provinces, we are able to achieve fewer overdrafts and deficits! "
"7770",1999,"Mandela","This is not merely a stroke of good fortune. "
"7771",1999,"Mandela","It is a result of hard work; and congratulations go to these public representatives and administrations.  "
"7772",1999,"Mandela","Last year, we spoke of the need to cut expenditure on personnel, as part of reducing a bloated civil service and changing its orientation. "
"7773",1999,"Mandela","That commitment remains. "
"7774",1999,"Mandela","The new civil service regulations based on each individual's output, especially management, rather than just observance of rules, should see to the improvement of service to the public.  "
"7775",1999,"Mandela","Much progress has been made towards comprehensive agreement on redeployment and retrenchment. "
"7776",1999,"Mandela","Logically, this must be based on assessment of public needs and on the very objective of governance. "
"7777",1999,"Mandela","But let us emphasise that, none of the parties in these negotiations will or should be allowed to use these processes to delay decisive action on this issue.  "
"7778",1999,"Mandela","Within local government, there is steady progress in regularising finances, in implementing poverty-based assistance, in setting up mechanisms reduce the number of councils. "
"7779",1999,"Mandela","And there is now seldom need for national interventions to resolve unnecessary conflict between these structures and traditional leaders.  "
"7780",1999,"Mandela","But we must be honest and acknowledge that, in many respects, this level of government has often played itself out as an Achilles Heel of democratic governance. "
"7781",1999,"Mandela","This is not for the lack of structures and rules. "
"7782",1999,"Mandela","Where this happens, it has more to do with the behaviour and attitudes of cadres that all parties have deployed in these structures. "
"7783",1999,"Mandela","It is a matter of the survival of democracy, of the confidence that people will have in the new system, that all of us should pay particular attention to this issue. "
"7784",1999,"Mandela","The public is justified in demanding better service, more respect and greater concern for their needs rather than self-aggrandisement.  "
"7785",1999,"Mandela","Our hope for the future depends also on our resolution as a nation in dealing with the scourge of corruption. "
"7786",1999,"Mandela","Success will require an acceptance that, in many respects, we are a sick society.  "
"7787",1999,"Mandela","It is perfectly correct to assert that all this was spawned by apartheid. "
"7788",1999,"Mandela","No amount of self-induced amnesia will change this reality of history.  "
"7789",1999,"Mandela","But it is also a reality of the present that among the new cadres in various levels of government, you find individuals who are as corrupt as - if not more than - those they found in government. "
"7790",1999,"Mandela","When a leader in a Provincial Legislature siphons off resources meant to fund service by legislators to the people; when employees of a government institution set up to help empower those who were excluded by apartheid defraud it for their own enrichment, then we must admit that we are a sick society.  "
"7791",1999,"Mandela","This problem manifests itself in all areas of life. "
"7792",1999,"Mandela","More often than not, it is business people who launder funds to curry favour with public servants; it is ordinary citizens who seek to buy themselves out of trouble; it is strange religious leaders who sing praises to criminals or hoard land acquired by the foul means of apartheid. "
"7793",1999,"Mandela","All of us must work together for our redemption.  "
"7794",1999,"Mandela","Many mechanisms have been put in place or strengthened to investigate and ensure proper punishment for these vile deeds: the Public Protector, the Heath Commission, the Auditor-General, the Office for Serious Economic Offences, to name but a few. "
"7795",1999,"Mandela","Within government, more resources are being provided to allow them to do their work.  "
"7796",1999,"Mandela","And very practical resolutions emerged from the Public Sector Anti-corruption Summit held last November.  "
"7797",1999,"Mandela","By the time we go to the National Summit in March, which will be informed by the decisions of the Religious Morals Summit and the Public Sector Conference, all sectors of society, including business and the trade union movement, should have worked out concrete proposals to take this matter forward in a visible and meaningful way. "
"7798",1999,"Mandela","It is commendable that the Public Service Bargaining Chamber has this week agreed on drafting new disciplinary mechanisms to facilitate dealing with cases of corruption, mismanagement and incompetence. "
"7799",1999,"Mandela","Our nation needs, as matter of urgency, what one writer has called an ""RDP of the Soul"".  "
"7800",1999,"Mandela","When we succeed in changing our own way of doing things, when we make progress in transforming society at all levels, we shall not only be improving our own quality of life. "
"7801",1999,"Mandela","We shall also be laying the basis for a future of hope for our children and grandchildren.  "
"7802",1999,"Mandela","We know too well that, if there is a problem of unemployment, it is the youth who bear the brunt of it. "
"7803",1999,"Mandela","If there are high incidences of crime, it is the youth who are misused as foot-soldiers and consumers of illegal substances. "
"7804",1999,"Mandela","If there is corruption and lack of morality, it is they who suffer a warped upbringing. "
"7805",1999,"Mandela","If we do not rid ourselves of the culture of violence, it is the youth who will be infected with it.  "
"7806",1999,"Mandela","It is therefore encouraging that youth organisations have started to play a more visible role in initiatives such as the Jobs Summit and community service. "
"7807",1999,"Mandela","We value the increasingly powerful role they are starting to play in the critical campaign against HIVIAIDS. "
"7808",1999,"Mandela","They do have the capacity to make a special contribution to breaking the silence which fuels this epidemic; as we shall all be doing during the coming National Condom Week when we focus on prevention.  "
"7809",1999,"Mandela","This leadership role by the youth reinforces my own hope in the future of our country and our nation. "
"7810",1999,"Mandela","And I wish to, all on all the youth of our country, in their millions, to recognise their civic duty in all spheres of life, including taking part in exercising their right to elect a government of their choice.  "
"7811",1999,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  I referred at the beginning to the letters written by a notorious prisoner. "
"7812",1999,"Mandela","In one of them, he said:  ""I am disturbed, as many other South Africans no doubt are, by the spectre of a South Africa split into two hostile camps: blacks on one side... and whites on the other, slaughtering one another; by acute tensions which are building up dangerously in practically every sphere of our lives. . .""  "
"7813",1999,"Mandela","As I said earlier, we have collectively managed the transition in a commendable manner.  "
"7814",1999,"Mandela","But it is matter of public record that elements of these divisions remain. "
"7815",1999,"Mandela","We slaughter one another in our words and attitudes. "
"7816",1999,"Mandela","We slaughter one another in the stereotypes and mistrust that linger in our heads, and the words of hate we spew from our lips. "
"7817",1999,"Mandela","We slaughter one another in the responses that some of us give to efforts aimed at bettering the lives of the poor We slaughter one another and our country by the manner in which we exaggerate its weaknesses to the wider world, heroes of the gab who astound their foreign associates by their self-flagellation. "
"7818",1999,"Mandela","This must come to an end. "
"7819",1999,"Mandela","For, indeed, those who thrive on hatred destroy their own capacity to make a positive contribution.  "
"7820",1999,"Mandela","To the extent that the apprehensions about the meaning of democracy relate to real fears about matters such as language and culture, we are proud that progress is being made towards the establishment of the Commission on these and other issues so that all can feel secure as part of a united nation.  "
"7821",1999,"Mandela","To the extent that some of the apprehensions are imagined or based on opposition to change, to that extent we are convinced that history will be the best teacher.  "
"7822",1999,"Mandela","We hope though, especially as we go into the election campaign, that real leaders will emerge who base their messages on hope rather than fear; on the optimism of hard work rather than the pessimism of arm-chair whining.  "
"7823",1999,"Mandela","Dealing with these challenges also means accepting the facts of our history. "
"7824",1999,"Mandela","As I said when I received the TRC Interim Report last October, the government accepts it with its imperfections. "
"7825",1999,"Mandela","We recognise that it is not a definitive or comprehensive history of the period it was reviewing; neither was it a court of law. "
"7826",1999,"Mandela","It was an important contribution on the way to truth and reconciliation.  "
"7827",1999,"Mandela","The critical act of reconciliation, to come back to the letters I referred to earlier, is the dismantling of what remains of apartheid practices and attitudes. "
"7828",1999,"Mandela","Reconciliation, without this major step, will be transient, the ode of false hope on the lips of fools.  "
"7829",1999,"Mandela","It will therefore be critical, that when we go into the detail of the TRC report's recommendations in the coming period, we must elaborate concrete plans about how together we can make practical contributions. "
"7830",1999,"Mandela","This applies particularly to reparations, not so much to individuals, but to communities and the nation as a whole.  "
"7831",1999,"Mandela","Let me reiterate that we shall all assist that process of nation-building and reconciliation, reconstruction and development, by protecting the institutions which guarantee the checks and balances that make social and political aberrations impossible. "
"7832",1999,"Mandela","Our word of acknowledgement to the Human Rights Commission, the Gender Commission and others for the sterling work they are doing to strengthen democracy.  "
"7833",1999,"Mandela","We should also underline that, while it is a matter of design rather than accident, that our social programmes for the poor impact most significantly on the lives of women, this is but a small element in dealing with gender relations. "
"7834",1999,"Mandela","Need we remind ourselves that the greatest number of violent crimes that we have referred to take place in the home and mostly against women! "
"7835",1999,"Mandela","Need we remind ourselves of the various forms of discrimination that still exist in the work-place, schools, places of worship and other social activity!  "
"7836",1999,"Mandela","But we should also derive pride that, never in the history of this country has any government done so much to improve the status of women - black and white: and this, with their active participation!  "
"7837",1999,"Mandela","The institution of the independent judiciary has been throughout these first years of our freedom been a fundamental pillar of our democracy. "
"7838",1999,"Mandela","And it continues to be.  "
"7839",1999,"Mandela","It is matter of great pride that we have established a dispensation in which no-one, not even the President, is above the law. "
"7840",1999,"Mandela","And for this, we owe thanks to the men and women of integrity who serve in this institution.  "
"7841",1999,"Mandela","Another pillar of our democracy is the Independent Electoral Commission; and we respect it as we do all the others. "
"7842",1999,"Mandela","Like all other such bodies, it is being assisted in various ways in accordance with the mission set out in the constitution, and what the country can afford. "
"7843",1999,"Mandela","I should indicate that, after rational discussion, agreement was reached that the IEC should be allocated more than R160-million in additional funds, in the coming budget year, further to enable it to fulfil its functions. "
"7844",1999,"Mandela","For the work that it has done to register potential voters, the IEC deserves our encouragement.  "
"7845",1999,"Mandela","But it is you the citizen who has to come out voluntarily to register and take part in South Africa's governance. "
"7846",1999,"Mandela","We urge those who have not registered to do so without delay. "
"7847",1999,"Mandela","Democracy needs your voice.  "
"7848",1999,"Mandela","Because of the impediment placed before us by some of the parties in this parliament, I am unable to formally announce the election date. "
"7849",1999,"Mandela","It is the insistence that we retain the option, contained in the constitution, for Premiers to announce their own election dates - and not any reluctance on the part of the President - that this matter cannot be settled here and now.  "
"7850",1999,"Mandela","I am however able to give the indication, after extensive consultations, that we aim to select a day for our second national election in the period between the 1 8'h and 27'h of May.  "
"7851",1999,"Mandela","Honourable Members and Delegates;  If we dare ourselves to succeed in this endeavour, it is because the benefit will be primarily ours. "
"7852",1999,"Mandela","But there is a sense in which it will be for all humanity, the majority of whom took part in efforts to help us achieve our democracy.  "
"7853",1999,"Mandela","Naturally, Southern Africa is our most critical point of reference. "
"7854",1999,"Mandela","As we progress towards social and economic integration in the region, we are guided by the need to reverse the legacy of our past in the form of a trade balance skewed in South Africa's favour.  "
"7855",1999,"Mandela","The re-negotiation of the Southern African Customs Union and the progress towards a SADC free trade area, slow as they may seem to outside observers, are making progress along a path that is rneaningful and sustainable. "
"7856",1999,"Mandela","Amongst the many concrete symbols of the integrated reconstruction of our region is the progress towards the establishment of a Southern African Electricity Power Pool co-ordinated from Harare, which will also augment the region's power from the rehabilitated Cahora Bassa project.  "
"7857",1999,"Mandela","These firm steps towards integration are part of the renewal of our continent, an African Renaissance campaign which is growing to become a continental movement.  "
"7858",1999,"Mandela","Our celebration of the millennium must reinforce this campaign and draw our artists, intellectuals and journalists more actively into this enterprise. "
"7859",1999,"Mandela","Sports events such as the Africa Games in Greater Johannesburg this Spring, and the African Cup of Nations in Zimbabwe next year, should form part of this celebration of Africa's rebirth.  "
"7860",1999,"Mandela","Fundamental to our success in generating this rebirth is to root out the causes of conflicts which are ravaging parts of the continent.  "
"7861",1999,"Mandela","It is with great concern that we see Angola once more threatened with all-out war. "
"7862",1999,"Mandela","We do ask ourselves whether the time has not come to draw basic lessons from this experience: to pose the question whether the United Nations' approach has been what is required of a situation in which one party rejects the results of a free and fair election.  "
"7863",1999,"Mandela","In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we do welcome the growing realisation that political inclusivity in transition is one of the solutions required. "
"7864",1999,"Mandela","There can be no winner in the military contest; there can only be untold suffering to the African people.  "
"7865",1999,"Mandela","Further afield, we remain hopeful that the protracted conflicts and the terrible suffering of civilians in countries such as Sierra Leone, Somalia and the Sudan will be brought to an end.  "
"7866",1999,"Mandela","And looking beyond our continent, we join all humanity in calling for a speedy resolution of the problems in the Middle East and in East Timor.  "
"7867",1999,"Mandela","If I may I would like to say a few brief words on Lesotho. "
"7868",1999,"Mandela","There is no doubt that SADC's collective initiative succeeded in creating the space for this country's political leaders to find a peaceful resolution of their differences; and we ought to take this opportunity to congratulate the Botswana and South African Defence Forces on their decisive contribution; and to pay tribute to those who lost their lives.  "
"7869",1999,"Mandela","We wish to assure members of our Defence Force that the nation is behind them in their endeavours: be it in the fight against crime, in peace-keeping operations or in their calm and professional assistance to voter registration. "
"7870",1999,"Mandela","We remain as committed as ever to equip the Force in a manner that ensures its effectiveness and adds value to the economy.  "
"7871",1999,"Mandela","The building of our region and the renewal of our continent, to which we have referred, in turn form part of the broader movement of developing countries to eradicate poverty and overcome the historical imbalances between North and South.  "
"7872",1999,"Mandela","The successful Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Durban last year has brought South Africa the opportunity to assist in asserting the interests of the developing world on serious issues facing humanity.  "
"7873",1999,"Mandela","Amongst the most pressing of these is the debt burden as well as the need to bring under control the vast movements of capital which wash across the globe without much social benefit, and with the capacity to undo years of industrialisation where it is most urgently needed.  "
"7874",1999,"Mandela","The initiatives under discussion to manage these rampant effects of globalisation, including unfair protectionist measures in some industrialised countries, require the reform of Bretton Wood institutions, and even more critically, the United Nations Security Council, in conformity with the democratic ethos of our age. "
"7875",1999,"Mandela","We are encouraged that more and more nations are starting to recognise not only the need for this, but its urgency as well.  "
"7876",1999,"Mandela","We are proud as a country that over the last four-and-half years, we have broadened our relations with developing countries of Asia - now the second largest bloc with whom we trade - as well as Latin America across the Atlantic. "
"7877",1999,"Mandela","Our strategic location places us well to act as a bridge linking these two important regions and the African continent.  "
"7878",1999,"Mandela","We scarcely need to add that this burgeoning of our links with the countries of the South is not in opposition to the our relations with Japan, the United States, Europe, including Russia, or the new strategic partnership we are building with the People's Republic of China. "
"7879",1999,"Mandela","On the contrary, they serve to enlarge the possibilities for truly equitable partnerships of mutual benefit to all our peoples.  "
"7880",1999,"Mandela","For a country that not many years ago was the polecat of the world, South Africa has truly undergone a revolution in its relations with the international community. "
"7881",1999,"Mandela","The doors of the world have opened to South Africa, precisely because of our success in achieving things that humanity as a whole holds dear. "
"7882",1999,"Mandela","Of this we should be proud.  "
"7883",1999,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  As we reflect on the years of transition and beginnings of transformation, we have cause to draw inspiration from what South Africans can do. "
"7884",1999,"Mandela","We dare to hope for a brighter future, because we are prepared to work for it. "
"7885",1999,"Mandela","The steady progress of the past few years has laid the foundation for greater achievements. "
"7886",1999,"Mandela","But the reality is that we can do much, much better.  "
"7887",1999,"Mandela","In the discussions that I have had with Deputy President Mbeki, we have posed to ourselves the question whether we should be satisfied with steady progress. "
"7888",1999,"Mandela","Is South Africa not capable of breaking out of the current pace and moving much faster to a better life?  "
"7889",1999,"Mandela","As the Deputy President has often said, the policies we have accord with the needs of the moment. "
"7890",1999,"Mandela","There is no need to change them. "
"7891",1999,"Mandela","Yet the speed and style of implementing them can be improved. "
"7892",1999,"Mandela","There are a few ingredients to this that need further attention. "
"7893",1999,"Mandela","To elaborate on some of them:  The first ingredient is Partnership: If we examine the major successes that have been made this year in addressing the most serious problems we face, one factor stands out above all others: and that is partnership among various sectors of society. "
"7894",1999,"Mandela","The Jobs Summit, the new AIDS Awareness Campaign, the summits on morality and corruption, and the issue of security in the farming communities are concrete examples from recent months. "
"7895",1999,"Mandela","So too was last year's successful Masakhane Focus Week. "
"7896",1999,"Mandela","And it is in this spirit that we shall on Freedom Day announce this year's winners of the President's Award for Community Initiative.  "
"7897",1999,"Mandela","These initiatives have resulted in major advances, as society mobilises hand-in-hand with government, to tackle the issues head on. "
"7898",1999,"Mandela","As such, one of the launching pads to faster progress has to be the mobilisation of South African society to act in unison on critical issues facing the nation.  "
"7899",1999,"Mandela","The second element is Discipline - the balance between freedom and responsibility: Quite clearly, there is something wrong with a society where freedom is interpreted to mean that teachers or students get to school drunk; warders chase away management and appoint their own friends to lead institutions; striking workers resort to violence and destruction of property; business-people lavish money in court cases simply to delay implementation of legislation they do not like; and tax evasion turns individuals into heroes of dinner-table talk.  "
"7900",1999,"Mandela","Something drastic needs to be done about this. "
"7901",1999,"Mandela","South African society - in its schools and universities, in the work-place, in sports, in professional work and all areas of social interaction - needs to infuse itself with a measure of discipline, a work ethic and responsibility for the actions we undertake.  "
"7902",1999,"Mandela","Thirdly, and related to the above is the question of reconstruction of the soul of the nation, ""the RDP of the Soul"": by this we mean first and foremost respect for life; pride and self-respect as South Africans rather than the notion that we can thrive in senseless self-flagellation.  "
"7903",1999,"Mandela","It means asserting our collective and individual identity as Africans, committed to the rebirth of the continent; being respectful of other citizens and honouring women and children of our country who are exposed to all kinds of domestic violence and abuse. "
"7904",1999,"Mandela","It means building our schools into communities of learning and improvement of character. "
"7905",1999,"Mandela","It means mobilising one another, and not merely waiting for government to clean our streets or for funding allocations to plant trees and tend school-yards.  "
"7906",1999,"Mandela","These are things that we need to embrace as a nation that is nurturing its New Patriotism. "
"7907",1999,"Mandela","They constitute an important environment for bringing up future generations. "
"7908",1999,"Mandela","They are about the involvement of South Africans in building a better life.  "
"7909",1999,"Mandela","Thus we shall take not just small steps, but giant leaps to a bright future in a new millennium. "
"7910",1999,"Mandela","As we confounded the prophets of doom, we shall defy today's merchants of cynicism and despair. "
"7911",1999,"Mandela","We shall, as we said in those letters of ten years ago, fully dismantle apartheid and achieve true reconciliation. "
"7912",1999,"Mandela","Our hopes will become reality.  "
"7913",1999,"Mandela","The foundation has been laid - the building is in progress. "
"7914",1999,"Mandela","With a new generation of leaders and a people that rolls up its sleeves in partnerships for change, we can and shall build the country of our dreams!"
"7915",1999,"Mandela"," Madames Speaker and Deputy Speaker. "
"7916",1999,"Mandela","Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces and Deputy Chairperson (one revolving, the other one permanent), Premiers of our Provinces, Distinguished representatives of local government, Deputy President of the Republic, Honourable Members of our National Parliament, Your Excellencies Ambassadors and High Commissioners, Distinguished guests:  We are on course.  "
"7917",1999,"Mandela","Steadily, the dark clouds of despair are lifting, giving way to our season of hope.  "
"7918",1999,"Mandela","Our country which, for centuries, has bled from a thousand wounds is progressing towards its healing.  "
"7919",1999,"Mandela","The continuing process of social and national emancipation, to which we are all subject, constitutes an evolving act of self-definition.  "
"7920",1999,"Mandela","At the dawn of a new life, our practical actions must ensure that none can challenge us when we say - we are a nation at work to build a better life!  "
"7921",1999,"Mandela","When the millions of our people went to vote three weeks ago in peaceful elections that were free and fair, they guaranteed the permanence of the foundations from which we will advance to meet this objective.  "
"7922",1999,"Mandela","To these masses we owe the obligation to recommit the government on whose behalf I speak, to the construction of a people-centred society. "
"7923",1999,"Mandela","This I am happy to do with all the authority at my command.  "
"7924",1999,"Mandela","What will guide us in everything we do will be the challenge to build a caring society.  "
"7925",1999,"Mandela","This society must guarantee the dignity of every citizen on the basis of a good quality of life for every woman, man and child, without regard to race, or colour or disability.  "
"7926",1999,"Mandela","It must be sustained by a growing economy capable of extending sustainable and equitable benefits to all our people.  "
"7927",1999,"Mandela","We seek to replace a society which, in many instances, has been and continues to be brutal and brutish in the extreme.  "
"7928",1999,"Mandela","Over the centuries this has condemned millions to a catastrophic loss of national identity and human dignity, land dispossession, classification and denigration as sub-humans and the systematic destruction of families and communities.  "
"7929",1999,"Mandela","The society we seek to replace was, to a very significant degree, built on the law of the jungle of the survival of the fittest.  "
"7930",1999,"Mandela","Accordingly, the weakest who were denied access to power became the landless, the unemployed, the uneducated, the surplus people deported to the so-called homelands, the victims of abject poverty.  "
"7931",1999,"Mandela","Among these are those in our cities and towns who have lost all hope and all self-worth, who have slid into a twilight world of drug and alcohol abuse, the continuous sexual and physical abuse of women and children, of purposeless wars fought with fists and boots, with metal rods, knives and guns, everyday resulting in death and grievous bodily harm.  "
"7932",1999,"Mandela","The society we seek to replace entrenched corruption in all areas of human activity informed by the notion that the concepts of right and wrong are dead and, therefore, that everything that serves my personal interests is permissible.  "
"7933",1999,"Mandela","What we have said shows the enormity of the challenge we face to succeed in creating the caring society we have spoken of.  "
"7934",1999,"Mandela","For this reason this is not a task that can be carried out by the government alone. "
"7935",1999,"Mandela","The challenge of the reconstruction and development of our society into one which guarantees human dignity, faces the entirety of our people.  "
"7936",1999,"Mandela","It is a national task that calls for the mobilisation of the whole nation into united people's action, into a partnership with government for progressive change and a better life for all, for a common effort to build a winning nation.  "
"7937",1999,"Mandela","The Government therefore commits itself to work in a close partnership with all our people, inspired by the call - Faranani! - to ensure that we draw on the energy and genius of the nation to give birth to something that will surely be new, good and beautiful.  "
"7938",1999,"Mandela","We invite all those in our country who occupy positions of authority and power to join in this new way of doing things, by engaging the people whom they serve and lead in the common effort to transform all of us into a people at work for a better South Africa.  "
"7939",1999,"Mandela","One of the central features of the brutish society we seek to bring to an end is the impermissible level of crime and violence. "
"7940",1999,"Mandela","Acting together with the people, we will heighten our efforts radically to improve the safety and security of all our citizens.  "
"7941",1999,"Mandela","This will entail a variety of measures focussed on ensuring the effective implementation of the national crime prevention strategy. "
"7942",1999,"Mandela","Let me mention a few of these, relating mainly to policing.  "
"7943",1999,"Mandela","We will work to improve the professional competence and effectiveness of the Police Service by introducing new human resource development programmes.  "
"7944",1999,"Mandela","I am also pleased to announce that new recruits with the requisite levels of education will be brought into the Service to help transform the Police Service into the pride of the nation.  "
"7945",1999,"Mandela","Appropriate measures will be taken to give these recruits the necessary training so that they can assume their positions as soon as possible at all levels, including the senior management echelon.  "
"7946",1999,"Mandela","At the same time, all relevant regulations will be reviewed to ensure the proper promotion and deployment of serving members, taking into account their competence, honesty and dedication and the need to end the racial and gender imbalances within the Police Service.  "
"7947",1999,"Mandela","Steps will be taken to review the conditions of service of the Police Service with a view to their improvement.  "
"7948",1999,"Mandela","This must also help us to ensure that we raise the public status of our policemen and police women so that they are seen, correctly, as the frontline guarantors of the fundamental human rights to liberty, life, safety and security.  "
"7949",1999,"Mandela","To enable our law enforcement agencies to translate this into reality, I am privileged to announce that a special and adequately staffed and equipped investigation unit will be established urgently to deal with all national priority crimes, including police corruption.  "
"7950",1999,"Mandela","I have directed that the Ministers of Safety and Security, Defence, Intelligence, Justice, Home Affairs and Finance must finalise all outstanding matters which relate to the activation of this unit within a fortnight.  "
"7951",1999,"Mandela","Co-ordination of all security organs will be improved in accordance with the provisions of the National Crime Prevention Strategy.  "
"7952",1999,"Mandela","Taking into account developments since its passage and to ensure that nobody benefits from the proceeds of crime, amendments to the Prevention of Organised Crime Act will be introduced. "
"7953",1999,"Mandela","Legislation against money laundering will also be introduced.  "
"7954",1999,"Mandela","Legislation will also be introduced to ensure that we can deal mercilessly with all crimes involving guns, including the illegal possession of firearms, the killing of police officers, corruption within the criminal justice system and the intimidation of witnesses.  "
"7955",1999,"Mandela","A study conducted by the Co-ordination and Implementation Unit in the Office of the Deputy President has confirmed what surely all of us have known, of the correlation between crime, poverty and race.  "
"7956",1999,"Mandela","The areas of high crime concentration, including all crimes of violence, are the black and poor areas of our country.  "
"7957",1999,"Mandela","These include such areas as Tsolo in the Eastern Cape, Thabong in the Free State, Katlehong in Gauteng, Inanda in KwaZulu-Natal, KaNyamazana in Mpumalanga, Mafikeng in the North West, Galeshewe in the Northern Cape, Thohoyandou in the Northern Province and Mitchells's Plain in the Western Cape.  "
"7958",1999,"Mandela","We will therefore make multi-disciplinary interventions in these areas, starting with a few pilot areas, drawing in all spheres of government and engaging the people themselves in an offensive to ensure that we reduce the levels of crime in these areas which are characterised by a high incidence of crime.  "
"7959",1999,"Mandela","Measures will also be taken to strengthen the Community Police Fora to improve their capacity to mobilise the people against crime and to improve co-operation between the people and the law enforcement agencies.  "
"7960",1999,"Mandela","As we have said, the partnership between the Government and the people will be one of the hallmarks of the national offensive against crime and violence.  "
"7961",1999,"Mandela","We will also adopt this same approach of partnership with the people in the fight against corruption. "
"7962",1999,"Mandela","In this regard, we must ensure that we pass the Open Democracy Act and move speedily to ensure the implementation of the provisions relating to the protection of whistleblowers.  "
"7963",1999,"Mandela","The coming into force of the Public Finance Management Act will also increase our capacity to ensure proper control and accountability with regard to public finances.  "
"7964",1999,"Mandela","New steps will also be taken to ensure the enforcement of the Code of Conduct for Public Servants as well as the proposals that emerged from the government and national anti-corruption conferences held during 1998 and 1999.  "
"7965",1999,"Mandela","In this regard, standing arrangements will be entered into, requiring that the Public Service Commission and the representatives of the private sector account publicly for the actions to which they committed themselves at the conferences.  "
"7966",1999,"Mandela","A further impetus will have to be given to the initiative of Religious Leaders against Corruption to achieve the ""RDP of the soul"" which Nelson Mandela spoke about.  "
"7967",1999,"Mandela","I would like to take this opportunity once more to reiterate the commitment of our government to honest, transparent and accountable government and our determination to act against anybody who transgresses these norms.  "
"7968",1999,"Mandela","The South African Revenue Service, the Police Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions will further strengthen their co-operation in the fight against financial and economic crimes.  "
"7969",1999,"Mandela","The example set by SARS of openness with regard to violations of the law, regardless of social standing of the violators, will be maintained.  "
"7970",1999,"Mandela","Urgent work is proceeding to determine the possibility of establishing special commercial crime courts as soon as possible as well as the gathering of the necessary complement of intelligence officers, investigators and prosecutors to ensure that we deal effectively with white-collar crime.  "
"7971",1999,"Mandela","The caring society of which we have spoken must, of course, successfully address the challenge of meeting the material needs of our people.  "
"7972",1999,"Mandela","The Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and the Growth, Employment and Redistribution Programme (GEAR) were implemented by our first democratic government to achieve socio-economic transformation and macro-economic stability.  "
"7973",1999,"Mandela","The structural changes entailed within these processes were also to take place within the context of our economy becoming more competitive as it integrated itself within the global economy.  "
"7974",1999,"Mandela","The RDP and GEAR will remain the basic policy objectives of the new government to achieve sustainable growth, development and improved standards of living.  "
"7975",1999,"Mandela","At the same time, we will actively address any remaining impediments to investment and job creation. "
"7976",1999,"Mandela","Where the structural changes already achieved allow us to evolve new policies, we will do so.  "
"7977",1999,"Mandela","Among other things, the revised GDP figures announced on the 21st of June confirm both the structural change that has taken place within our economy and the fact of a more robust economic performance than the pessimists would have us believe.  "
"7978",1999,"Mandela","The challenge remains for all of us to get to know the real South Africa and, in this context, to fight back to defeat a frame of mind which drives some among us to hope and pray for failure and to celebrate such failure whenever it has occurred, or when we have convinced ourselves that it has occurred.  "
"7979",1999,"Mandela","Our task is to build on the achievements reflected in the economic realities reflected in the figures issued by Statistics South Africa at the beginning of this week.  "
"7980",1999,"Mandela","Accordingly, we have to work to increase both the level of investment and the savings ratio. "
"7981",1999,"Mandela","This will include further steps to eliminate any dis-saving by the state and to introduce incentives to encourage saving.  "
"7982",1999,"Mandela","The improvements in the deficit and debt ratios indicated in the latest GDP figures, will also give us some space further to increase public sector capital expenditure.  "
"7983",1999,"Mandela","This will strengthen the improvement in capital expenditure by public authorities and public corporations reported in the GDP figures to which we have referred.  "
"7984",1999,"Mandela","The further transformation of the state machinery will result in changes to the public expenditure patterns, against personnel costs, in favour of capital expenditure, including maintenance.  "
"7985",1999,"Mandela","These processes will also involve the provincial sphere of government.  "
"7986",1999,"Mandela","The Municipal Infrastructure Programme is now beginning to progress. "
"7987",1999,"Mandela","To increase the momentum requires further improvements in local government financial management.  "
"7988",1999,"Mandela","It also requires concerted action to promote public-private partnerships, which must be constructed on a fiscally sound and sustainable basis.  "
"7989",1999,"Mandela","These matters, affecting the critical local government sphere will be attended to in a vigorous manner.  "
"7990",1999,"Mandela","Investment by the public sector is closely associated with the restructuring of state assets. "
"7991",1999,"Mandela","Progress in this area has been made over the last five years. "
"7992",1999,"Mandela","We are now at a stage where further important restructuring can and will take place.  "
"7993",1999,"Mandela","In the telecommunications sector, there will be further developments with the issuing of new licences. "
"7994",1999,"Mandela","This will have a further positive impact on the expansion and modernisation of our telecommunications infrastructure, the affordability of services to consumers and investment in the economy.  "
"7995",1999,"Mandela","I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that former minister, Jay Naidoo, will continue to work in this sector to assist in its further development domestically and to promote the African Connection, which is a critical element of the African Renaissance.  "
"7996",1999,"Mandela","Some of the most important developments with regard to the restructuring of state assets will relate to Transnet. "
"7997",1999,"Mandela","In part, the priority given to this corporation arises from the fact that the transport and logistic system it contains underpins the success of other major investment projects.  "
"7998",1999,"Mandela","These include the Spatial Development Initiatives, the Industrial Development Zones, cross-border initiatives, the industrial participation programmes arising out of the defence procurement as well as our overall export drive.  "
"7999",1999,"Mandela","The complex work that had to be done to prepare the Transnet corporation for its restructuring enabled us to put part of the national carrier, South African Airways on the market.  "
"8000",1999,"Mandela","I am pleased to announce that the winning bidder is Swissair which will acquire 20 per cent of SAA at a price of R1,4 billion.  "
"8001",1999,"Mandela","We are very satisfied with this result, convinced that it will bring maximum benefits to our country, further strengthen our relations with the Confederation of Switzerland and again demonstrate in practical terms the importance of a measured approach towards the important issue of the restructuring of public assets.  "
"8002",1999,"Mandela","I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate our new strategic partner and to thank the Honourable Stella Sigcau for the work she did to enable us to reach the important stage we have, during which we will deal with other business units within the Transnet group.  "
"8003",1999,"Mandela","Similarly, the liquid fuels and petro-chemical industry will be given priority, with the Ministries of Minerals and Energy, Trade and Industry and Public Enterprises acting together.  "
"8004",1999,"Mandela","This includes finalisation of discussions with the Government of Mozambique with regard to a gas pipeline from their gas fields to South Africa.  "
"8005",1999,"Mandela","The outcome of these processes will result in adding a highly competitive dimension to the productive economies of southern Africa.  "
"8006",1999,"Mandela","The Government will continue to intensify its work to facilitate investment by the private sector, ensuring that the institutions that have been established to promote investment and the system of incentives achieve the desired results.  "
"8007",1999,"Mandela","Further to improve our effectiveness in these areas, we will shortly establish an International Investment Council.  "
"8008",1999,"Mandela","This prestigious Council, which will include some of the leading players in the global economy who are driven by a passionate desire to ensure that we succeed as a country, will work with the President, as well as our leading business people and trade unionists to help us ensure that South Africa is an attractive destination for foreign investment.  "
"8009",1999,"Mandela","Consistent with our determination to strengthen our partnership with the people for the achievement of our common goals, four Working Groups will also be established bringing government together with big business, the black business sector, commercial agriculture and the trade unions.  "
"8010",1999,"Mandela","The development of small, medium and micro enterprises remains a top priority of government. "
"8011",1999,"Mandela","Accordingly, new measures will have to be instituted to record more success than has been the case to date.  "
"8012",1999,"Mandela","We have listened very carefully to what the actors in this area of the economy have said. "
"8013",1999,"Mandela","Accordingly, the policy and institutional framework to support and encourage this sector is being reviewed. "
"8014",1999,"Mandela","We will announce new decisions in this regard within the next three months.  "
"8015",1999,"Mandela","The Government will also place more emphasis on the development of a co-operative movement to combine the financial, labour and other resources among the masses of the people, to rebuild our communities and engage the people in their own development through sustainable economic activity.  "
"8016",1999,"Mandela","There are two other areas that have an impact on investment.  "
"8017",1999,"Mandela","Interest rates remain high. "
"8018",1999,"Mandela","The Reserve Bank and the Ministry of Finance will continue to address this matter carefully, conscious of the negative impact these high rates have on the desired higher rates of investment and growth.  "
"8019",1999,"Mandela","The other area that has attracted considerable comment is the labour market and its actual or perceived impact on investment and job creation. "
"8020",1999,"Mandela","Much of this commentary is ill informed or promotes a particular ideological or political point of view.  "
"8021",1999,"Mandela","The most recent independent study on this issue was published by the ILO in February, this year.  "
"8022",1999,"Mandela","The report states that:  "" One of the key findings of the study was that when compared to other middle-income countries, labour regulations on dismissal, fixed-term contracts and working conditions do not appear to be particularly onerous..."
"8023",1999,"Mandela","A degree of numerical adaptability (at exit) does exist - thus dismissing the view that inflexible labour markets are at the heart of the employment problem..."
"8024",1999,"Mandela","Unfortunately employers perceive that the recent ""avalanche"" of labour market policy now make it more onerous to employ. "
"8025",1999,"Mandela","These perceptions, whilst they may not be rooted in reality when one considers the regulatory environment in other countries, do appear to be influencing the behaviour of the economic actors...""  "
"8026",1999,"Mandela","The Government will continue to give priority to the issue of job creation. "
"8027",1999,"Mandela","If perceptions or realities influence the process negatively, these must be addressed.  "
"8028",1999,"Mandela","Accordingly, in keeping with the decisions taken at the Job Summit, consultations have been taking place with our social partners to identify such possible areas.  "
"8029",1999,"Mandela","These include probation, remedies for unfair dismissals, dismissals for operational requirements, the extension of bargaining council agreements and certain provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.  "
"8030",1999,"Mandela","We will continue to discuss these matters with our social partners to address the efficiency of the labour market.  "
"8031",1999,"Mandela","Job creation, the opening up of opportunities for all our people to earn an honest living as well as the protection of the rights of all our working people, remain matters of critical concern to the Government.  "
"8032",1999,"Mandela","We will continue actively to address all these matters, including such important questions as skills development, the casualisation of labour, illegal foreign workers and workers whose rights are not protected.  "
"8033",1999,"Mandela","All necessary measures will be taken to ensure the implementation of all other decisions taken at the Job Summit. "
"8034",1999,"Mandela","The necessary funds have already been voted to meet the commitments the Government made at this Summit.  "
"8035",1999,"Mandela","All our partners have an obligation themselves publicly to report on the actions they have taken and are taking to honour their undertakings.  "
"8036",1999,"Mandela","An important project that will soon be implemented within the context of the Job Summit will be the improvement of public buildings to enhance access and use by disabled people. "
"8037",1999,"Mandela","This initiative, elaborated by the disabled, the National Youth Commission and Public Works will be implemented soon, as part of the programme decided at the Job Summit.  "
"8038",1999,"Mandela","The Umsobomvu Fund for youth development and training will become operational as soon as the Old Mutual has completed its demutualisation process.  "
"8039",1999,"Mandela","The Board of Trustees of the National Development Agency will be constituted shortly. "
"8040",1999,"Mandela","Hopefully, this will assist in ensuring the further mobilisation of the people themselves to participate in the development process as agents working for social change and their own advancement.  "
"8041",1999,"Mandela","I am pleased to announce that, immediately, the Minister of Trade and Industry will make recommendations to the Government with regard to those who competed to run our national lottery.  "
"8042",1999,"Mandela","This important matter will be concluded within the next fourteen days. "
"8043",1999,"Mandela","In a few months, it will be possible to allocate even more resources to the promotion of the good causes to which the Government and institutions such as the NDA and the IDT are committed.  "
"8044",1999,"Mandela","Madam Speaker, the rural areas of our country represent the worst concentrations of poverty. "
"8045",1999,"Mandela","No progress can be made towards a life of human dignity for our people as a whole unless we ensure the development of these areas.  "
"8046",1999,"Mandela","The Government is now in a position to implement a rural development programme for the integrated development of the rural areas. "
"8047",1999,"Mandela","This will bring together all government departments and all spheres of government, including the traditional leaders.  "
"8048",1999,"Mandela","The integration we seek must, for instance, ensure that when a clinic is built, there must be a road to access it. "
"8049",1999,"Mandela","It must be electrified and supplied with water.  "
"8050",1999,"Mandela","It must have the requisite personnel, qualified to meet the health needs of the particular community.  "
"8051",1999,"Mandela","The safety and security of the personnel and material resources which are part of the clinic must be guaranteed.  "
"8052",1999,"Mandela","We must also establish the conditions which give the possibility to this medical point to radiate outwards as a point of reference with regard to the larger project of our self-definition as a people at work, building a better life for ourselves.  "
"8053",1999,"Mandela","Consistent with our concentration on this objective, including the critical importance of jobs, the Government remains preoccupied with the issue of gold sales and their impact on gold mining, employment and export earnings, both in our own country and the rest of our Continent.  "
"8054",1999,"Mandela","Working within the Gold Crisis Committee, we will continue to maintain contact will all relevant players both domestically and throughout the world to minimise the inevitable adverse effect on our country, our people and our Continent.  "
"8055",1999,"Mandela","The debt burden of those who cannot both carry this debt and achieve sustained development must be addressed.  "
"8056",1999,"Mandela","In the same way that we have demonstrated our own commitment to contribute to the development of others less fortunate than ourselves, by forgiving the debts of some of our neighbours, we expect that those who are a thousand time wealthier than we are, will not seek to help us as Africans by rendering us less capable of standing on our own feet.  "
"8057",1999,"Mandela","Further to improve the quality of life of all our people, especially the most disadvantaged, the Government will maintain its approach to reprioritise public spending to maintain and improve the safety net available to the most disadvantaged in our society.  "
"8058",1999,"Mandela","It is however vital that we improve the quality of spending in these areas and therefore the delivery of services to the people.  "
"8059",1999,"Mandela","This will be done by managing downwards the amounts spent on personnel, rooting out corruption and theft, improving management skills throughout the social sector and ensuring an integrated, inter-departmental approach to the delivery of services.  "
"8060",1999,"Mandela","Special programmes will also be introduced to speed up the improvement of the quality of life of various sections of our population.  "
"8061",1999,"Mandela","These will include the accelerated delivery of assistive devices for the disabled and the establishment of one-stop centres for abused women and children.  "
"8062",1999,"Mandela","The Office on the Status of Women will present a gender audit to Government by September. "
"8063",1999,"Mandela","This will enable the Government to evaluate the progress achieved with regard to the implementation of the Plan of Action on Gender, which the previous government adopted.  "
"8064",1999,"Mandela","This will enable us to take such decisions as may be necessary to ensure that we continue to focus on the vital question of the development and emancipation of women as well as further integrate this issue within all government programmes.  "
"8065",1999,"Mandela","The advances made in this National Parliament and the National Executive with regard to gender equity, point to the need to adopt a similar approach with regard to all other centres of authority and power in our society.  "
"8066",1999,"Mandela","Similarly, the Government will tighten its tracking of the poverty question to ensure that government policies and programmes are actually succeeding to reduce the levels of poverty in our country.  "
"8067",1999,"Mandela","The funds set aside for poverty alleviation will also be allocated without further delay and will be used not as handouts but as a catalyst towards sustainable development.  "
"8068",1999,"Mandela","The Government will also review all the work done so far to confront the scourge of HIV/AIDS with a view to the intensification of all efforts relating to this epidemic.  "
"8069",1999,"Mandela","Of critical importance will be that we take all necessary steps to ensure that the partnerships against HIV/AIDS that have been formed and the public education campaigns we have been conducting do actually result in changing behaviour patterns, improve support to AIDS victims and orphans and speed up steps towards the development of a vaccine.  "
"8070",1999,"Mandela","An historic document of the people of our country asserts that as a consequence of the victory of the struggle for national liberation - the doors of education and learning shall be open to all!  "
"8071",1999,"Mandela","Many people, including our youth, died and sacrificed for the realisation of this objective. "
"8072",1999,"Mandela","They did so because they understood the importance for themselves and all our communities of the right to freedom from ignorance.  "
"8073",1999,"Mandela","Consistent with this correct view, we must ensure that education and training constitute the decisive drivers in our effort to build a winning nation.  "
"8074",1999,"Mandela","The Government will therefore intensify its focus on education so that we succeed in our effort to produce an educated and appropriately skilled population.  "
"8075",1999,"Mandela","A great deal of work has been done in this area affecting all levels of education and training. "
"8076",1999,"Mandela","We will therefore ensure that existing policies and programmes are carried out with a sense of urgency and commitment to their success.  "
"8077",1999,"Mandela","To achieve these results, we will also have to engage in massive in-service training programmes for educators in all fields and at all levels, as well as the transformation of pre-service training.  "
"8078",1999,"Mandela","We will have to focus on an outcomes-based assessment as well as on quality management systems. "
"8079",1999,"Mandela","Our human resource development strategies will only succeed if the people assigned to develop our human resources have the capacity to do so.  "
"8080",1999,"Mandela","All necessary steps must and will be taken to ensure that learners learn, educators educate and managers manage.  "
"8081",1999,"Mandela","Once more we will also take the necessary measures to mobilise the people, including the parents, so that we succeed as a country to meet the challenge of educating all our people in a manner that is consistent with the demands imposed on everybody by the process of globalisation.  "
"8082",1999,"Mandela","The Government is also determined to ensure that the machinery of state is geared towards serving the people in keeping with the vision of ""Batho pele!""  "
"8083",1999,"Mandela","We will speed up the completion of the Skills and Service Audits currently being carried out. "
"8084",1999,"Mandela","This audit is aimed at defining service needs, the availability of skills and the possibilities for redeployment to support the process of the restructuring of the public service.  "
"8085",1999,"Mandela","Action will be taken on the basis of this audit, as well as other initiatives, to right-size the public service, to improve skills levels, to improve the quality of management and release more resources for the actual provision of services to the people.  "
"8086",1999,"Mandela","We will also work with the South African Local Government Association to lend all necessary assistance to ensure that this sphere of government improves its effectiveness and efficiency, bearing in mind that this is the point at which our entire system of government delivers services to the people.  "
"8087",1999,"Mandela","In this context, we must make the point that to overcome the problem of urban poverty, will require that local government adopts and pursues a consistent programme of poverty relief, without discrimination on the basis of race or colour.  "
"8088",1999,"Mandela","Our Government is ready and willing to support this effort.  "
"8089",1999,"Mandela","The promotion and protection of the cultural, linguistic and religious rights of all our people must occupy a central place in the work of Government.  "
"8090",1999,"Mandela","It should not happen that anyone of us should feel a sense of alienation. "
"8091",1999,"Mandela","Whatever the sicknesses of our society, none should be driven to levels of despair which drive them to a peripheral existence at the fringes of the mainstream.  "
"8092",1999,"Mandela","Nor should we allow that those who were denied their identity, including the Khoi and the San, continue to exist in the shadows, a passing historical relic and an object of an obscene tourist curiosity.  "
"8093",1999,"Mandela","We consider the work of restoring the pride and identity of all our people of vital importance to the task of advancing the human dignity of all our citizens and ensuring the success of our efforts towards national reconciliation and nation building.  "
"8094",1999,"Mandela","We will work for the speedy implementation of the constitutional requirement to establish a Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Language, Cultural and Religious Rights.  "
"8095",1999,"Mandela","We will also work with the traditional leaders to resolve all outstanding matters relating to the important question of the role of our traditional leaders in our system of governance.  "
"8096",1999,"Mandela","The Ministries of Sports and Recreation as well as Arts, Culture, Science and Technology will play a special role with regard to the critical work to ensure that all our cultures and languages occupy their rightful place within the rich tapestry that constitutes our diverse being as a people.  "
"8097",1999,"Mandela","This will be an important contribution to the effort we must sustain to wipe out the legacies of racism and sexism, which continue to afflict our society.  "
"8098",1999,"Mandela","Capacity will be created within the Presidency to ensure that our Government, at its highest levels, gives attention to all these questions which bear on nation building.  "
"8099",1999,"Mandela","The Government will also focus on the tasks of achieving the objectives of the African Renaissance and ensuring that the next century evolves as the African century.  "
"8100",1999,"Mandela","We will therefore contribute whatever we can towards the resolution of conflicts on our Continent. "
"8101",1999,"Mandela","We cannot accept that war, violent conflict and rapine are a permanent condition of existence for us as Africans.  "
"8102",1999,"Mandela","Nor can we accept that our Continent, endowed with enormous human and natural resources, is incapable of achieving sustained development.  "
"8103",1999,"Mandela","Everyday all those who will hear and see are exposed to the extraordinary integrated cultural heritage which both captures our African past and is an important factor that will contribute towards the recovery of our pride and dignity.  "
"8104",1999,"Mandela","Gradually, Africa will work her way towards the resumption of her rightful place among the continents of our globe.  "
"8105",1999,"Mandela","Where necessary, we will call on the services of such outstanding African statespersons as former Presidents Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, Sir Ketumile Masire and Nelson Mandela to assist in the promotion of this agenda.  "
"8106",1999,"Mandela","As part of the world community of nations, we will make our due contribution to the construction of a new world order that will be responsive to the needs of especially the poor of the world.  "
"8107",1999,"Mandela","For us to succeed in our work, both as a Government and as a people, will require that we approach the tasks ahead with all due seriousness and a sense of discipline which recognises the fact that all rights are accompanied by obligations.  "
"8108",1999,"Mandela","It will require that all of us defend the freedoms and the system of government guaranteed and created by our Constitution, underpinned by the understanding that the people are the final guarantors of our democracy, the subject of all government policies and their own liberators.  "
"8109",1999,"Mandela","As the people went to the polls earlier this month, protected among others by our National Defence Force, which had also acted to defend life and democracy in Lesotho, they expected that the government they would elect would work selflessly to respond to their needs and aspirations, bearing in mind resource limitations.  "
"8110",1999,"Mandela","We dare not and will not disappoint that expectation.  "
"8111",1999,"Mandela","As a tribute to these masses, I would like to salute all the provincial winners of the President's Award for Community Initiative.  "
"8112",1999,"Mandela","I am happy to announce that the national winner of the Award, whose work focused on such important issues as poverty alleviation, the emancipation of women, the rebuilding of communities, domestic violence and providing education on HIV/AIDS, is the Makgaung Community Project of the Northern Province.  "
"8113",1999,"Mandela","May the selfless and creative work carried out by the women of the Northern Province serve to inspire all of us to spare no effort in the struggle to create a caring society.  "
"8114",1999,"Mandela","We sit in this parliament, authorised by these women from the Northern Province and others who mirror them throughout our country, to work as their representatives.  "
"8115",1999,"Mandela","We must assume that they were wise to have selected us.  "
"8116",1999,"Mandela","If they were, as we must accept in our self interest that they were, this we must accept also that none of us should forsake their wisdom, as it will watch over us as we carry out our tasks.  "
"8117",1999,"Mandela","Their wisdom will protect us, exalt and honour us, even as it costs us all we have, including the vanity of our prejudices.  "
"8118",1999,"Mandela","If, by word and deed, we take our places among the ordinary people who position themselves among a nation that is at work to build a better life for all within a caring society, then should we expect that the poor of the world will set a garland of grace on our heads and present each and everyone of us with a crown of splendour.  "
"8119",1999,"Mandela","Thus will we all arrive at the starting point - that we are on course!  "
"8120",1999,"Mandela","Thank you."
"8121",1998,"Mandela"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly; honourable Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons of the National Council of Provinces; honourable Members of Parliament; Distinguished guests; Ladies and Gentlemen:  I should start by expressing my appreciation for this opportunity to exchange views with you at the beginning of this penultimate sitting of our first democratic parliament.  "
"8122",1998,"Mandela","I wish all of you a productive New Year in the service of the people.  "
"8123",1998,"Mandela","As government, we are confident of the progress being made to meet our mandate. "
"8124",1998,"Mandela","We are resolved to build on the solid foundation that has been laid over the past three-and-a-half years. "
"8125",1998,"Mandela","As always, the most critical challenge is whether we are succeeding as leaders to mobilise the people in actual practice to be their own liberators.  "
"8126",1998,"Mandela","We know too well that on our own we cannot succeed. "
"8127",1998,"Mandela","We know that the programmes of government are not the panacea for all the ills of our terrible past. "
"8128",1998,"Mandela","They are but a platform for South Africans to let their strengths shine through.  "
"8129",1998,"Mandela","By our own pronouncements and actions, we could relate to these citizens as passive recipients of government delivery, as if government were a force on high. "
"8130",1998,"Mandela","Worse still, we could turn some constituents into passive critics, their own rationality drowned in the chorus of regret that the past has passed. "
"8131",1998,"Mandela","On both counts, this would be a recipe for sure failure.  "
"8132",1998,"Mandela","That is why, during the course of last year, we once again put the Masakhane campaign at the centre of our activities. "
"8133",1998,"Mandela","And our performance should be judged above all on the basis of whether our programmes are positively affecting the lives of especially the most vulnerable sections of society: the poor, women, the disabled, children and the rural masses - the primary victims of the iniquitous system from which we have just emerged. "
"8134",1998,"Mandela","We are proud to answer this question in the affirmative.  "
"8135",1998,"Mandela","Last year, we increased the supply of clean and accessible water from 700 thousand to 1,3 million South Africans.  "
"8136",1998,"Mandela","We have surpassed our plans to build or upgrade 500 clinics last year; and the primary school feeding scheme reaches 4,9-million children.  "
"8137",1998,"Mandela","From 250 thousand in 1996, we are in line to make 421 thousand telephone connections this financial year, making life that much easier for millions of South Africans.  "
"8138",1998,"Mandela","With more than 400 thousand electricity connections in 1997 alone, today South Africa has reached a 58% electrification level so millions can have light.  "
"8139",1998,"Mandela","Besides the impressive land redistribution programmes, the law on secure tenure will bring more certainty in the lives of over six million citizens.  "
"8140",1998,"Mandela","There is no magic in numbers as such. "
"8141",1998,"Mandela","But we are proud that, through these and many other projects, our programmes are impacting on the lives of particularly the poor. "
"8142",1998,"Mandela","This applies to varying degrees with regard to other challenges to which we shall later return.  "
"8143",1998,"Mandela","And it is all a result of a clear strategy, properly managed plans, good governance and, more than anything else, the determination of the overwhelming majority of our country-men and -women to change their lives for the better. "
"8144",1998,"Mandela","It is therefore understandable that, unlike some of us, those who bore the brunt of apartheid oppression say that things are a lot better.  "
"8145",1998,"Mandela","But they also say, and are justified to say so, that what has been done is not enough. "
"8146",1998,"Mandela","Not because they expect the legacy of centuries of colonialism to be eradicated in a few years, as we ourselves have said on countless occasions before. "
"8147",1998,"Mandela","Not because they are frustrated with government. "
"8148",1998,"Mandela","But because they appreciate that together we need to much more, over many years, to realise a truly just and prosperous government, they have a serious, committed and caring institution - a government that they can call their own.  "
"8149",1998,"Mandela","We are at the beginning of an arduous and protracted struggle for a better quality of life. "
"8150",1998,"Mandela","In the course of this struggle, we shall have immediate successes; we shall have setbacks; but we shall certainly progress, inch by inch, towards our goal.  "
"8151",1998,"Mandela","From time to time, incidents do happen which bring out in bold relief the enormity of the challenges we face. "
"8152",1998,"Mandela","As the saying goes, one falling tree makes more noise than millions that are growing. "
"8153",1998,"Mandela","As such, for both good reason and bad, occasional problems are seized upon by our detractors as the stock-in-trade of this government; indeed as the essence of democracy.  "
"8154",1998,"Mandela","I will raise a few of them, particularly, difficulties with regard to old age pensions, education, crime and corruption, housing and job-creation, because they touch on the very essence of the issues of resources to meet our obligations, the size of the public service and its management, civic duty and a new morality.  "
"8155",1998,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  A few weeks ago, the problem of disbursement of old age pensions and other social grants came to the fore.  "
"8156",1998,"Mandela","Let me start off by saying that, in the way that we increased old age pensions last year, and as we eliminate fraud, we shall seek to find resources this year for a further increase - modest as it may be - working towards a life of dignity for our senior citizens. "
"8157",1998,"Mandela","Let me further emphasise that we are committed - not merely because of statutory obligations, but because we care - to ensure that, whatever the occasional administrative hiccups, the right to a pension will always be met.  "
"8158",1998,"Mandela","What has not received much public coverage is the fact that the problems we experienced recently derived from:  * Firstly, that the audit of our newly integrated system is not only eliminating ""ghosts""; but it also identified people who were callously refused these pensions under the apartheid system and its bantustan off-shoots. "
"8159",1998,"Mandela","They are today on the roll; and it was decided that their right to back-pay could not be disregarded.  "
"8160",1998,"Mandela","* Secondly, the measures that have been taken to eliminate corruption have uncovered many fraudsters in the government machinery, but we still have a long way to go to resolve this problem.  "
"8161",1998,"Mandela","* Thirdly, some public servants are, to put it mildly, not imbued with the spirit of public service - to the extent that even in instances where these funds are available, they do not turn up on time and/or they relate to senior citizens with attitudes bordering on the criminal.  "
"8162",1998,"Mandela","Through co-operation between national and provincial movements concerned, we shall ensure that these problems are dealt with methodically and with a ruthless determination.  "
"8163",1998,"Mandela","Related to this, we did indicate last year that we expected some teething problems in the first year of total budget allocations to the provinces. "
"8164",1998,"Mandela","Indeed, we need to pause here, to pay tribute to the provincial administrations, which were able to come through without debilitating desolation. "
"8165",1998,"Mandela","Given the serious problems identified by central government Task Teams last year, it is thanks to the efforts of all provinces without exception that the problems have not been much worse. "
"8166",1998,"Mandela","But we must eliminate overspending.  "
"8167",1998,"Mandela","A related and critical matter is the issue of how the public resources at our disposal correspond with the social backlog that we have inherited.  "
"8168",1998,"Mandela","In our view, the starting point in addressing the question of the national budget and public finances in general is that we cannot behave like fools who cut their noses to spite their faces: to throw policy out of the window in search of fractions of percentages in deficit targets. "
"8169",1998,"Mandela","We have creatively to strive to meet our obligations within the context of a reduction of the public debt.  "
"8170",1998,"Mandela","Indeed, we cannot pretend that the deficit targets we have set ourselves do not test our capacity and will. "
"8171",1998,"Mandela","But we cannot divert from the course we have chosen. "
"8172",1998,"Mandela","There is no other route to sustainable development.  "
"8173",1998,"Mandela","Two critical matters arise from this.  "
"8174",1998,"Mandela","In the first two years of our democracy, we sought to use the special mechanism of a so-called RDP Fund to lever changes in the patterns of departmental spending. "
"8175",1998,"Mandela","Today this task is built into the normal functions of all departments. "
"8176",1998,"Mandela","Reprioritisation and more reprioritisation is the challenge that we shall continue to grapple with in the coming years.  "
"8177",1998,"Mandela","For if we should not and cannot cut down on houses and clinics being built, on the supply of water, on improving the quality of education including the building and equipping of schools, on improving policing and so on, then we have to cut down elsewhere.  "
"8178",1998,"Mandela","There have been some commendable savings from better cash flow management. "
"8179",1998,"Mandela","But it is not nearly enough.  "
"8180",1998,"Mandela","And we cannot use the proceeds of privatisation to fund salaries and other consumption expenditure.  "
"8181",1998,"Mandela","Put in simple terms, we need to cut spending on personnel.  "
"8182",1998,"Mandela","I am confident that all of us, and the trade union movement in particular, will agree that apartheid South Africa was over-governed and over-supervised. "
"8183",1998,"Mandela","The size of the public service had nothing to do with public service.  "
"8184",1998,"Mandela","On the other hand, democratic governance is management of a process whereby people govern themselves. "
"8185",1998,"Mandela","Government is not an employment agency.  "
"8186",1998,"Mandela","This year, we shall go into this question without equivocation. "
"8187",1998,"Mandela","Frankly put, we shall need to start comprehensive discussions with the unions on retrenchment in accordance with the provisions of our labour laws. "
"8188",1998,"Mandela","These negotiations will need to take into account the principle that shedding jobs in the public service does not necessarily have to translate into worsening the problem of unemployment.  "
"8189",1998,"Mandela","For instance, retrenchment packages that include investment capital and tender obligations on the part of government can in fact help expand the job market especially in depressed rural areas. "
"8190",1998,"Mandela","We shall, as a matter of urgency, require our public service department and provinces to work out proposals in this regard.  "
"8191",1998,"Mandela","Jobs, jobs and jobs is the clarion call that should guide us. "
"8192",1998,"Mandela","We do pride ourselves with the health of our economic fundamentals: the declining rate of inflation; the incentives that we introduced which have attracted over R7-billion in investments; close on to 400 projects related to Spatial Development Initiatives such as the Maputo Corridor which have attracted investments to the tune of about R77-billion; the rising graph of productivity; and increased exports.  "
"8193",1998,"Mandela","With regard to the budget, we have introduced transparency and certainty through the Medium-term Expenditure Framework. "
"8194",1998,"Mandela","And tax collection is improving as more people are brought into the net. "
"8195",1998,"Mandela","We can quote many more examples, including a relatively stable exchange rate in the face of global adversity; and the hundreds of thousands of jobs created through the public works, municipal infrastructure and investment promotion programmes. "
"8196",1998,"Mandela","But the economy continues to shed too many Jobs.  "
"8197",1998,"Mandela","This is in part because the rate of investment, particularly by ourselves as South Africans, is not enough. "
"8198",1998,"Mandela","Within an overall increase in fixed investments of about 3%, public authorities show a massive decline in the ratio of growth of capital expenditure. "
"8199",1998,"Mandela","Public corporations are doing much better and they need to be commended for this. "
"8200",1998,"Mandela","The rate of growth of productive private investments has not been impressive.  "
"8201",1998,"Mandela","As such, we should all agree that the issue is not merely one of government creating a favourable environment to attract investments. "
"8202",1998,"Mandela","This it has done with commendable determination. "
"8203",1998,"Mandela","What is required is a deliberate effort to increase investments: the type of investments which create jobs.  "
"8204",1998,"Mandela","These are the things, I am told, that the various sectors in NEDLAC are addressing in preparation for the Jobs Summit. "
"8205",1998,"Mandela","By the time of this Summit, we hope that a real partnership will have emerged among government, business and labour to tackle this critical task.  "
"8206",1998,"Mandela","One will not be exaggerating to say that, given its impact on everything else we do as a nation, including crime prevention, reconciliation and the very survival of our democracy, the Jobs Summit is perhaps the most important event since our first democratic elections; an important launching pad for a determined national drive as we move into the 21st century.  "
"8207",1998,"Mandela","It is quite clear that as we finalise preparations for this Summit, we cannot continue to imprison ourselves in the paradigm of large profits and only large profits as the driving force of business operations. "
"8208",1998,"Mandela","We cannot continue to wallow in the illusion that the protection of the narrow interests of the employed is the driving force to poverty alleviation.  "
"8209",1998,"Mandela","We must launch joint efforts towards an economy that creates jobs; towards a society that cares by helping the unfortunate in its ranks to help themselves.  "
"8210",1998,"Mandela","Honourable Members and Delegates;  Within the context of facilitating economic growth, transfer of technology and black empowerment, we have made great progress in the programme to restructure state assets. "
"8211",1998,"Mandela","As we promised a the last opening of parliament, the previous year has seen Telkom acquire strategic partners; SunAir has been privatised; South African Airways is completing its restructuring towards acquiring a strategic partner. "
"8212",1998,"Mandela","While the Airports Company and SAFCOL processes are taking longer than anticipated, they are on their way to completion this year.  "
"8213",1998,"Mandela","The pace in the restructuring programme is broadly in keeping with our set time frames. "
"8214",1998,"Mandela","Where difficulties have been experienced, they represent lessons both about our past and our present.  "
"8215",1998,"Mandela","With the Aventura Holiday Resorts for instance, a government of the people could not ignore the complex land claims that are attached to some of these resorts. "
"8216",1998,"Mandela","With Alexkor in diamond mining, we once again learnt that much information about the net worth of many state assets has been concealed by those who ran the previous government, or they simply did not care about these assets. "
"8217",1998,"Mandela","But we are on course to resolve the problems.  "
"8218",1998,"Mandela","I wish once more to reiterate that, for us, the issue of restructuring of state assets is not driven by ideology. "
"8219",1998,"Mandela","We shall privatise where necessary. "
"8220",1998,"Mandela","But we shall also set up new state enterprises where market imperfections and failures play themselves out to undermine social programmes. "
"8221",1998,"Mandela","Such is the case with elements of the liquid fuels industry and the servicing of housing construction, which has not received the optimum support from the banking industry. "
"8222",1998,"Mandela","Restructuring also means strengthening management of existing enterprises, a programme that we have intensified.  "
"8223",1998,"Mandela","On the issue of housing in particular it is necessary to go back to the basics.  "
"8224",1998,"Mandela","The numbers of close on to 400 thousand subsidised houses either completed or under construction and about 700 thousand subsidies allocated are important indicators of progress. "
"8225",1998,"Mandela","But as we indicated earlier, there is no magic in numbers as such: and the target of 1 million houses in five years, provided directly by government, may not be attained. "
"8226",1998,"Mandela","What we need to examine closely is whether, after the delays in the launch of the housing programme in 1994, we have mustered the capacity to accelerate this programme. "
"8227",1998,"Mandela","And the answer is, yes!  "
"8228",1998,"Mandela","The pace of housing construction is accelerating. "
"8229",1998,"Mandela","Today one thousand houses are started or completed every two-and-a-half days, and, as a result of our programmes, 1,2 million South Africans have a permanent roof over their head.  "
"8230",1998,"Mandela","In consultation with some of the banks, we have cleared hundreds of so-called redlined areas; we have ensured over 60 thousand loans at the upper end of the subsidy market; many constructors have been registered; monitoring of quality and the capacity of provinces have been enhanced.  "
"8231",1998,"Mandela","In addition to issues of quality, questions have also been posed about the sizes of houses that are being built. "
"8232",1998,"Mandela","Going back to the basics here means appreciating that government is focusing on the poor and most vulnerable sectors of society.  "
"8233",1998,"Mandela","If we have to reach the widest spectrum of these citizens, with the resources available, we cannot increase the size of the subsidy. "
"8234",1998,"Mandela","In addition to services and a plot of land that families can call their own, possibilities are left for them to exercise initiative with the resources available, and to improve the basic structure when they are in a position to do so.  "
"8235",1998,"Mandela","Indeed, among the proudest moments of this programme is the involvement of the people themselves, especially women, who through their own labour and creativity are able to achieve much more with less. "
"8236",1998,"Mandela","In consultation with local government, we have also started to examine in greater detail the question of density, integrated development and rental accommodation.  "
"8237",1998,"Mandela","In brief, whatever the difficulties and initial delays in the first five years, we are on course to ensure that, in the end, there shall be housing and security for all.  "
"8238",1998,"Mandela","Honourable members and delegates will agree that significant progress has been made in transforming education, including adult basic education, from the mess it was under apartheid. "
"8239",1998,"Mandela","Today, children starting their schooling can for the first time do so just as children - not a black piccanini or a white kleinbaas. "
"8240",1998,"Mandela","From the self-criticism last year about the school-building projects, we are happy that provinces have started to use more of the funds set aside for this purpose.  "
"8241",1998,"Mandela","But as in other areas, there have been moments in this sphere which bring to the public mind the enormity of the tasks that we face. "
"8242",1998,"Mandela","Such were the matric results of last year. "
"8243",1998,"Mandela","It is encouraging that, in typical South African style, after the brief flurry of accusations and counter-accusations, we started to focus attention on the real issues. "
"8244",1998,"Mandela","Among these issues is the fact that the standard of the papers was somewhat higher and security of exams somewhat tighter; most inconsequential subjects taken in the past simply to fill a certificate were done away with; the marking was more rigorous and there were minimal adjustment of the marks. "
"8245",1998,"Mandela","As such, though ironic to say, there were fewer but better passes.  "
"8246",1998,"Mandela","This is not to detract from the fact that we have only scratched at the surface of the legacy of apartheid education. "
"8247",1998,"Mandela","Many children still study under trees and dilapidated buildings. "
"8248",1998,"Mandela","Many schools are hollow shells without even the most basic equipment for normal teaching. "
"8249",1998,"Mandela","Many teachers do not have the capacity to transmit knowledge in a professional manner. "
"8250",1998,"Mandela","And some simply do not see it as their civic duty to relocate to areas in need.  "
"8251",1998,"Mandela","There are inexcusable and unacceptable delays in the supply of textbooks which derive from poor management and shoddy tendering deals; let alone the non-existence of malfunctioning of many school governing bodies.  "
"8252",1998,"Mandela","Yet, when all is said and done, many schools in disadvantaged areas have shown that serious application to duty by the school authorities and the students can bring positive results. "
"8253",1998,"Mandela","We pay tribute to these heroes.  "
"8254",1998,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  This spirit of community, of partnership and of hard work is required when dealing with problems of crime and corruption.  "
"8255",1998,"Mandela","Again, in this area, the tendency often is to exaggerate and distort the real situation; to use half-truths and sensationalism to paint a picture of a situation out of control. "
"8256",1998,"Mandela","It is understandable that unscrupulous politicians, media commentators and those who wish to question the legitimacy of the democratic process as such will conjure up crises in the heads, where in reality there are no crises.  "
"8257",1998,"Mandela","The task of those interested in improving the country's quality of life is to examine the real situation in its complex forms, even if this may not please the prophets of doom.  "
"8258",1998,"Mandela","That reality is that, since 1994, there has been a marked decline in virtually all serious crimes such as murder, robbery, taxi violence, car-hijacking and others. "
"8259",1998,"Mandela","In other words, since this democratic government came into being, there has been a decline in most serious crimes. "
"8260",1998,"Mandela","This is a result of better co-ordination among all arms of the security services: the police, the intelligence services and the defence force, as well as co-operation across Southern Africa. "
"8261",1998,"Mandela","One such example of effective co-ordination is in the farming areas, where there is an 80% success rate in apprehending the murderers.  "
"8262",1998,"Mandela","The National Crime Prevention Strategy has got off the ground. "
"8263",1998,"Mandela","And as we promised last year, the law on bail and mandatory sentences for serious crimes has been passed. "
"8264",1998,"Mandela","A Detective Academy - interestingly the very first one in the history of South Africa - has been opened to improve police's investigative capacity and skills to do their jobs. "
"8265",1998,"Mandela","Proposals on reducing commercial entry points including closing some so-called international airports have been finalised: and we hope that we shall receive the co-operation of all affected parties, despite the formal agreements that they may have entered into with the previous government.  "
"8266",1998,"Mandela","Among the elements which know how effective the security forces are becoming are the crime syndicates themselves. "
"8267",1998,"Mandela","It appears that from time to time, and not seldom during crucial political moments, they will engage in dramatic acts such as robbery of cash-in-transit, syndicate turf wars and prison escapes.  "
"8268",1998,"Mandela","But they know, better than any politician that the net is closing on them; that the intelligence services are on their heels even if it may take time to build water-tight cases against them; that wherever they may be hiding - even in the police and other state structures, in the private security companies, among prison warders and even the legal fraternity; that even if they may form a web of political forces bent on destabilising our young democracy - they know that their days are numbered.  "
"8269",1998,"Mandela","The same should be said about corrupt elements who see public service as an opportunity for self-enrichment. "
"8270",1998,"Mandela","Mechanisms are in place and are being improved all the time to root them out. "
"8271",1998,"Mandela","In this regard, I wish to thank the media for its vigilance. "
"8272",1998,"Mandela","While there may be instances where fingers were pointed at individuals without justification, there are a good many examples where investigative journalism has helped us uncover the scoundrels - old and new - who prey on the public purse.  "
"8273",1998,"Mandela","To find a lasting solution to all these challenges requires a community spirit among all of us, a New Patriotism which is finding root within the populace. "
"8274",1998,"Mandela","We must build our nation into a community of citizens who appreciate their civic duty as each one of us improves our well-being. "
"8275",1998,"Mandela","We must be ready to give back to society part of what we gain from it.  "
"8276",1998,"Mandela","In this respect, the words of one eminent citizen who has actively joined the campaign against crime are worth repeating in this august Assembly:  ""...this country, warts and all, has been good to me - it is unbelievable. "
"8277",1998,"Mandela","It has fed me; it has clothed me; it has educated me; it has given me opportunities in the business world that were unthinkable when I was a kid in Brits. "
"8278",1998,"Mandela","I think the very least I could do is put something back. "
"8279",1998,"Mandela","And this is my kind of national service and I am enjoying it ...""  "
"8280",1998,"Mandela","This is a challenge to all of us, especially those whose past privileges have afforded them skills that are in high demand in public service, to volunteer skills to help improve the lot of the nation.  "
"8281",1998,"Mandela","Indeed, on the vexed question of crime, we could do more if each South African of integrity consciously ask themselves everyday whether they may have assisted in the commission of crime:  * as a parent who conceals the activities of a child who is taking drugs, without assisting the police to track down the suppliers;  * as a customer who co-operates in a transaction which allows you a large discount because the seller will not pay VAT;  * as a trade unionist or ordinary worker who turns a blind eye to pilfering on the shop-floor or worse still to corruption in government service;  * as a politician who stands behind individuals who break the law, in the name of challenging bodies such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission;  * as a parent or spouse who avoids asking questions when a relative is suddenly awash with money, and behaves like a fugitive from justice.  "
"8282",1998,"Mandela","Don't many of us do this and more; and yet express bewilderment at the high rate of crime.  "
"8283",1998,"Mandela","What this emphasises is that we need a campaign of moral regeneration. "
"8284",1998,"Mandela","As we reconstruct the material conditions of our existence, we must also change our way of thinking, to respect the value and result of honest work, and to treat each law of the country as our own.  "
"8285",1998,"Mandela","This is our call to all South Africans to firm up the moral fibre of our nation. "
"8286",1998,"Mandela","It is a call to artists and musicians and sportspeople, to religious leaders and traditional institutions, to intellectuals, to the media and to all those who should give leadership as we established new symbols and role models: all of us to join hands in a New Patriotism; not because the government says so, but because it is in our common interest to do it.  "
"8287",1998,"Mandela","In this regard, it is encouraging that the youth of our country through the National Youth Commission have taken important steps to define a youth policy that will give all - irrespective of the skin colour that is the accident of birth - a stake in our new society. "
"8288",1998,"Mandela","Particularly heartening is the proposal for youth community service, which can be broadened to encompass most of society: be it in helping to clean streets, volunteering services in schools and so on.  "
"8289",1998,"Mandela","Civic duty is the central purpose behind the Masakhane Campaign, whose awareness week last year was fairly successful. "
"8290",1998,"Mandela","We shall continue this year and beyond to intensify this drive, including the mobilisation of, and assistance to, Non-Governmental and Community-Based Organisations who truly have the interests of the community at heart.  "
"8291",1998,"Mandela","Honourable Members and Delegates;  It is to promote the spirit of Masakhane that we set up the President's Award for Community Initiative. "
"8292",1998,"Mandela","This annual award honours those who roll up their sleeves and take the initiative to uplift their conditions.  "
"8293",1998,"Mandela","We are privileged today to have with us, as guests of the President, representatives of the nine communities that were the first Provincial Winners. "
"8294",1998,"Mandela","Selected from some two thousand entries, they embody the unquenchable determination of South Africans to better their own lives.  "
"8295",1998,"Mandela","We recognise the Buhlebemvelo Garden Project from KwaZulu-Natal; the Ikgodisent Sewing Project from Huhudi; the Malungeni Training and Development Centre; the Bekkersdal Flagship Project for unemployed mothers; the Dassie pre-school Centre from Oudtshoorn; the Khotsong Branch of the Homeless People's Federation; the Nkomazi Farmers Association, the Hantam Community Education Trust - and finally, the project which was yesterday announced as the National Winner of the President's Award for Community Initiative, the Mhala Development Centre in the Northern Province, set up by retrenched mineworkers working with their union and their former employer.  "
"8296",1998,"Mandela","Our congratulations to those whom you represent, and indeed to all the 54 runners-up. "
"8297",1998,"Mandela","May the financial prizes from government strengthen your efforts - and may your example inspire others to seek this honour in future years.  "
"8298",1998,"Mandela","There are also countless others outside the limelight who deserve our admiration, and gratitude, such as school principal Mr Mandla Hlatshwayo of Ndwedwe in KwaZulu-Natal, who braved a raging river during torrential rains to deliver matric examination papers to his students; the security guard who risked life and limb single-handedly to hold highway robbers at bay, leading to their arrest; the many sportspeople and other citizens who make us proud to be South African.  "
"8299",1998,"Mandela","This multifaceted effort to build our society on the basis of a new morality demands that we should be open about mistakes that we committed in the past. "
"8300",1998,"Mandela","Such is the importance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. "
"8301",1998,"Mandela","Because these mistakes were committed by us, so will their airing in public be hurtful and at times embarrassing. "
"8302",1998,"Mandela","But the more we know about how low we once sank, the more difficult it will be to repeat these mistakes.  "
"8303",1998,"Mandela","At the hearings of the TRC over the past year many horrid details emerged. "
"8304",1998,"Mandela","We cannot fail to have been moved by the remorse of some perpetrators, and the preparedness of victims to forgive. "
"8305",1998,"Mandela","We cannot fail to have been astounded by their very modest appeals for their dignity to be restored. "
"8306",1998,"Mandela","But this should not be surprising, for their suffering was not for pecuniary gain, but for the great prize of freedom and a better life for all.  "
"8307",1998,"Mandela","The government has heard the appeals for urgent reparations. "
"8308",1998,"Mandela","And we shall be ready to provide modest assistance when the details have been forwarded. "
"8309",1998,"Mandela","As part of the multi-year budget, account will be taken of the needs, within our limited resources; and we hope that those who benefited from the suppression of others will find it within themselves to make a contribution. "
"8310",1998,"Mandela","As the TRC moves towards finalising its work, we shall do our best to ensure that their needs are provided for. "
"8311",1998,"Mandela","But we know too that this will not be the end, but the beginning of the process of reconciliation.  "
"8312",1998,"Mandela","It is quite unfortunate that some among us still refuse to co-operate with the TRC. "
"8313",1998,"Mandela","Given that part of its task is to unmask the networks that not only violated human rights, but also formed one web with crime syndicates, the question will haunt such forces forever, why it is that they continue to conceal this information! "
"8314",1998,"Mandela","We need to make it clear that those who cringe at the banks of the Rubicon of truth, those who served in state structures and refused to apply for amnesty, will not be assisted by the state in the face of whatever consequences accrue to them from their past.  "
"8315",1998,"Mandela","Related to this is the danger of any political leadership and media to continue with the campaign of exploiting the fear, uncertainty and anxiety of certain communities about the transition. "
"8316",1998,"Mandela","The clamour among some parties to outdo one another in this regard is counter-productive, to say the least. "
"8317",1998,"Mandela","It worsens polarisation and stokes the fires that have the potential of consuming all of us.  "
"8318",1998,"Mandela","In any case, it is pointless because it will not stop change. "
"8319",1998,"Mandela","Transformation is this government's reason for existence; and we shall not for a moment shirk our responsibility to the poor. "
"8320",1998,"Mandela","This government is humane, and we know that the well-being of those previously denied their rights is the sure guarantee for the well-being of all.  "
"8321",1998,"Mandela","It is for this reason that it pains me personally when I listen to some of the debates in this chamber. "
"8322",1998,"Mandela","Always, a clear distinction emerges between those who were at the cutting edge of the struggle for freedom who strive for change; and those who implemented of benefited from oppression who seek to block transformation, in defence of a modified form of the old order.  "
"8323",1998,"Mandela","I should take this opportunity to pay homage to the institutions charged with the task of enhancing our democracy and culture of human rights. "
"8324",1998,"Mandela","If we say with confidence that South Africa will succeed, it is in part because we know there is a Constitutional Court, the Public Protector, the Human rights Commission, the Electoral Commission, which has started its challenging work, and the Auditor-General, all of which will assist in ensuring that what we do is not only constitutional, legal and legitimate, but that it is seen to be so by all and sundry, including the weakest among us.  "
"8325",1998,"Mandela","A word of congratulations to the Gender Commission which has started its work to ensure that our society is true to the principles of consistent equality in everything we do. "
"8326",1998,"Mandela","Yet this Commission and the Office on the Status of Women should not be seen as watchdogs of an alien force bent on doing wrong. "
"8327",1998,"Mandela","Rather society as a whole should see them as part of our joint efforts as men and women, to liberate themselves from gender prejudice.  "
"8328",1998,"Mandela","We are also encouraged by the systematic work being done regarding the position of the disabled. "
"8329",1998,"Mandela","What matters is not merely the thousands of wheel-chairs, hearing aids and tens of thousands of cataract operations provided in the past year alone; but also ensuring that the attitude in employment practises, in discourse, in design of infrastructure and more - all these should be changed with the participation of the disabled themselves.  "
"8330",1998,"Mandela","This year, we shall ensure the intensification of the efforts regarding multi-lingualism in government work, and we should thank the Pan-South African Language Board for its vigilance. "
"8331",1998,"Mandela","Further, after extensive consultations during the course of last year, we are a step closer towards the setting up of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities.  "
"8332",1998,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  Our programme for this year will once more seek to speed up the improvement of the lives of all, with particular emphasis on the most vulnerable and needy.  "
"8333",1998,"Mandela","Some of the additional highlights of this programme, whose detail will be announced by the various ministries during the course of next week, include:  Our commitment to meet our budget deficit targets, as we further improve the efficiency of tax collection. "
"8334",1998,"Mandela","As the further steps we took recently indicated, we shall continue, on a case-by-case basis, to lift exchange controls as conditions for such mature. "
"8335",1998,"Mandela","Construction starts on many Maputo Development Corridor projects; two new development initiatives in the Cape West Coast and Northern KwaZulu-Natal will be launched in the first half of the year. "
"8336",1998,"Mandela","Work starts in the West to complete the Highway across South Africa from Maputo to Walvis Bay. "
"8337",1998,"Mandela","The basic economy is being revolutionised.  "
"8338",1998,"Mandela","The integrated tourism programme will be launched in earnest, with the potential to create 300 thousand jobs by the turn of the century.  "
"8339",1998,"Mandela","In the work-place, the departure from apartheid practices will be felt even more keenly as we finalise and implement the bill on employment equity. "
"8340",1998,"Mandela","And let us hasten to add in this regard, that we shall not be discouraged by the sirens of self-interest that are being sounded in defence of privilege, and the insults that equate women, Africans, Indians, Coloureds and the disabled with a lowering of standards. "
"8341",1998,"Mandela","As we have said before, affirmative action is corrective action. "
"8342",1998,"Mandela","There is no other way of moving away from racial discrimination to true equality. "
"8343",1998,"Mandela","We therefore reject campaigns which are based on fear, rumour and gossip.  "
"8344",1998,"Mandela","Special attention this year will be paid to the further consolidation of Local Government, with its critical contribution in areas of infrastructure, job-creation, small business development and the very legitimacy of democracy. "
"8345",1998,"Mandela","We should also take this opportunity to acknowledge local government Delegates present her, and with them celebrate the beginning of their full participation in the National Council of Provinces and Inter-Governmental Forums.  "
"8346",1998,"Mandela","The White Paper and new legislation on local government which should be finalised this year will help streamline this sphere of government without derogating from representivity and accountability. "
"8347",1998,"Mandela","And to start meeting the requirements of the constitution in the context of poverty alleviation, over R3 billion will this year be equitably and directly allocated to this sphere of government.  "
"8348",1998,"Mandela","As we attend to these matters, particular attention will be paid to continued dialogue with traditional leaders, so as to ensure that all of them become full and active partners in the struggle for local development.  "
"8349",1998,"Mandela","This year also sees the launch of the new Government Communications and Information Service, which, we are certain, will contribute to the challenge to improve communication among South Africans, to afford citizens their rights to information and to air their views.  "
"8350",1998,"Mandela","Our continuing work to reduce incidents of crime will also pay particular attention to women and child abuse, crimes which, regrettably seem to be on the increase. "
"8351",1998,"Mandela","Special programmes for the 6 metropolitan areas which account for the bulk of violent crimes are being finalised for immediate implementation. "
"8352",1998,"Mandela","Let us once more underline to those who choose to live a life of violent crime, that as recent incidents regarding cash heists have shown, we shall, with the combined might of the security services, return fire with overwhelming fire.  "
"8353",1998,"Mandela","This year, we launch the programme that will streamline the judicial system so as to alleviate overcrowding in prisons, without creating any new dangers to society. "
"8354",1998,"Mandela","Above all, we shall appoint the National Director of Public Prosecutions and provincial counterparts - a first in the history of our country.  "
"8355",1998,"Mandela","Within the intelligence services, it has become even more urgent to unearth the few rotten apples who arrogantly pursue an agenda counter to transformation. "
"8356",1998,"Mandela","To put it mildly, they are an affront to our security and our pride as a nation; they are a blight on the commendable work that these services are doing to defend democracy.  "
"8357",1998,"Mandela","We are proud that, after a year of so of healthy and informative debate, we can now start the protracted process of re-equipping our National Defence Force. "
"8358",1998,"Mandela","We wish to congratulate the armed forces and economic ministries which have ensured that much of this will be done without a strain on the budget, and in a way that will benefit the economy.  "
"8359",1998,"Mandela","Our social programme will be aimed at accelerating implementation and consolidation of what has been achieved within the limits of our resources. "
"8360",1998,"Mandela","This includes:  * Ensuring that 90% of mothers and young children have access to free medical care; starting the child support grant system which will reach 3-million children by the fifth year; achieving an 85% cure rate for tuberculosis; implementing the new laws to make drugs and doctors accessible; and, in addition to the building of clinics, dedicating R100 million to the upgrading of hospitals.  "
"8361",1998,"Mandela","* In this, the Year of Science and Technology, our programmes to improve the learning environment, including the setting up of the Council on Higher Education, will be enhanced by a campaign to usher in a new and dynamic culture of scientific and technical innovation rooted in our schools, communities and enterprises.  "
"8362",1998,"Mandela","* In the next financial year, a further 580-thousand telephones will be installed. "
"8363",1998,"Mandela","And we aim to supply a further 1-million citizens with clean and accessible water. "
"8364",1998,"Mandela","At the same time, it is our responsibility, as the Water Bill is finalised, to change our own water consumption culture, recognising that this is a scarce resource that must not be squandered.  "
"8365",1998,"Mandela","As cabinet finalises these and other plans in the context of multi-year budgeting, we shall, as always be guided by our concern for the poor and most vulnerable sectors of society; to provide basic services, to improve the economy and job-creation, to deepen democracy and good governance and to improve the safety and security of all.  "
"8366",1998,"Mandela","I should also announce that, as a pro-active measure to further improve good governance and in accordance with the Constitution, the President's Office will this year start drafting legislation on ethics in government, including a statutory Code of Conduct applying to members of the executive at national and provincial levels.  "
"8367",1998,"Mandela","Honourable Members and Delegates;  In our efforts, we draw inspiration from countries that have to address problems to varying degrees similar to ours.  "
"8368",1998,"Mandela","In our relationship with the world, we can now confidently say that South Africa has found her niche as an independent participant in world affairs.  "
"8369",1998,"Mandela","Our starting point in these relations is the obvious: That South Africa is an African country. "
"8370",1998,"Mandela","Thus we draw pride from the fact of increased trade with Africa reflected in a 70% increase in exports and 60% in imports since 1995. "
"8371",1998,"Mandela","We shall continue to expand these relations and close co-operation with our sister African nations bilaterally and through the OAU, within the context of Africa's renaissance. "
"8372",1998,"Mandela","We are grateful that African nations have afforded us the opportunity to make our humble contribution to the resolution of problems and reconstruction in places like the now Democratic Republic of Congo, the Great Lakes Region and the Sudan.  "
"8373",1998,"Mandela","During the course of this year, we shall host Africa Telecom, to work out strategies and plans for the continent to become part of the communications highway.  "
"8374",1998,"Mandela","Within SADC, we were honoured to take collective leadership of the process towards a Free Trade Area. "
"8375",1998,"Mandela","The matters to be resolved on this course are complex and, as to be expected, there is much individual self-interest. "
"8376",1998,"Mandela","But the will and determination are there, including the difficult question of ensuring that the democratic gains that have been made over the past few years are not reversed.  "
"8377",1998,"Mandela","As an active and respected part of the developing world, we shall in August host the Summit of leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement. "
"8378",1998,"Mandela","As such we shall be afforded the opportunity to play a leadership role as these countries, in their own terms, define the nature and direction of globalisation. "
"8379",1998,"Mandela","All of us in these countries are concerned about the widening gap between the rich and the poor both within and among nations. "
"8380",1998,"Mandela","But we also recognise the challenge to ensure that our own co-operation helps to define the new world order.  "
"8381",1998,"Mandela","As a country, we are making strides in this direction: as shown by the fact that today, Asia is our second largest trading partner after Europe; and we are starting to exploit the huge potential that exists with regard to Latin America. "
"8382",1998,"Mandela","This year we started a strategic relationship with the People's Republic of China, the biggest nation on earth. "
"8383",1998,"Mandela","The launch last year of the Indian Ocean Rim Association is a great step that will re-establish, in the new age, strong relations that date back to pre-colonial days. "
"8384",1998,"Mandela","At the same time, we have intensified dialogue with the North about a common human agenda as we enter the millennium.  "
"8385",1998,"Mandela","In such dialogue, pertinent questions about the structure of the United Nations and its agencies, as well as the issues of the international financial system, the debt crisis and world trade, are on the agenda. "
"8386",1998,"Mandela","There is world consensus that solutions need to be found to the causes and rampant effects of stock market crashes that can beggar even those economies which have got their fundamentals in place.  "
"8387",1998,"Mandela","It is encouraging that the Commonwealth of Nations, a body-straddling the North-South divide, and whose summit we attended last year, put high on the agenda the issue of economic development. "
"8388",1998,"Mandela","Again, as a reflection of the place we occupy in international relations, this body decided to hold its 1999 summit in South Africa.  "
"8389",1998,"Mandela","Our relations with North American countries, Europe and Japan have grown from strength to strength. "
"8390",1998,"Mandela","We value these relations with our main trading partners and sources of investment and aid. "
"8391",1998,"Mandela","More particularly, we have now reached the point at which negotiations with the European Union on free trade should soon reach finality.  "
"8392",1998,"Mandela","We shall continue to make our humble contribution to the search for peace and the humane conduct of international relations. "
"8393",1998,"Mandela","Our condition on these issues, including the campaign for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines and nuclear disarmament, derives from our own experience about what humanity should not do to itself.  "
"8394",1998,"Mandela","Ahead of any other country, South Africa destroyed its stockpile of over 200 thousand land-mines in a record of 5 months. "
"8395",1998,"Mandela","The severed limbs of children, women and men in our neighbouring countries are a loud warning to us that, never again should our country be a source of destabilisation. "
"8396",1998,"Mandela","As such, we shall support the stern action taken by countries whose peace is disturbed by any South Africans.  "
"8397",1998,"Mandela","We are driven by this desire for peace when we urge for the resumption of Middle East peace talks on the basis of the Oslo Agreements. "
"8398",1998,"Mandela","We are driven by what we believe are the long-term interests of the Palestinian and Jewish communities when we condemn prevarication and provocation by those who calculate that they can use might to prevent right. "
"8399",1998,"Mandela","We condemn without equivocation violence by any party, for it feeds animosity rather than encourages reconciliation.  "
"8400",1998,"Mandela","In the same spirit, we call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara and East Timor, and we shall do our best to assist where we can.  "
"8401",1998,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  Wherever we go internationally, we are always moved by the appreciation of the world for our efforts in resolving problems that seemed intractable.  "
"8402",1998,"Mandela","These international forces are always willing to assist in our exciting transition. "
"8403",1998,"Mandela","But they recognise that, in the final analysis, our success will depend on our own efforts. "
"8404",1998,"Mandela","They appreciate and have confidence in our economic environment, and equally, they expect the same among South Africans themselves.  "
"8405",1998,"Mandela","They respect our nation because they know we are contributing to the collective efforts of humankind redefining itself and reclaiming its humanity as we move into the new millennium.  "
"8406",1998,"Mandela","This, our programme for 1998, is a humble contribution to the quest for a better world. "
"8407",1998,"Mandela","As always, we are encouraged, first and foremost, by the fact that South Africans are ready; and they have rolled up their sleeves to build a society that cares.  "
"8408",1998,"Mandela","These millions of South Africans are joining hands to sustain their democratic achievement; and they will protect it like the apple of their eye. "
"8409",1998,"Mandela","They are filled with hope about the bright future that beckons. "
"8410",1998,"Mandela","They shall not be distracted by the noise of a falling tree amidst the dignified silence of a new future starting to blossom; because they know that:  The foundation has been laid; and the building has begun!"
"8411",1997,"Mandela"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly; Honorable Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons of the National Council of Provinces; Honorable Members of Parliament; Distinguished guests; Ladies and Gentlemen:  A new year is upon us, once more affording us the opportunity to account in a comprehensive manner to the citizens on the awesome responsibilities they have mandated us to fulfill.  "
"8412",1997,"Mandela","All of us, in the executive and legislatures, the majority party and Members in the opposition benches, are called upon to outline practical programmes to improve the nation's quality of life.  "
"8413",1997,"Mandela","Again and again over the past year, the people showed remarkable commitment to the country's well-being. "
"8414",1997,"Mandela","They took advantage of resources offered through RDP projects. "
"8415",1997,"Mandela","They turned adversity into opportunity in the export market. "
"8416",1997,"Mandela","They excelled in international sporting events, including the Olympics and Paralympics. "
"8417",1997,"Mandela","And they joined hands to raise awareness around crime, and actually to work together to combat it.  "
"8418",1997,"Mandela","In practical action, a new nation is being forged; a nation whose New Patriotism and sense of pride derive not only from ideas in our hearts, but also from concrete progress made in improving the well-being of all.  "
"8419",1997,"Mandela","Our task is to mobilize all our people, to create more and more opportunities, to ensure that the citizen's potential is given the fullest expression. "
"8420",1997,"Mandela","We have to do this and more, sensitive to the feelings of the majority and the minority, the haves and the have-nots, those who have the media to communicate their ideas and those deprived of such resources.  "
"8421",1997,"Mandela","We can all derive pride from the fact that we took a historic step in this direction last year through the adoption of the new constitution: the basic law of our land reflecting the nation's yearning for a rising quality of life, in circumstances of democracy, peace and respect for human rights.  "
"8422",1997,"Mandela","In a sense this is the first session of the new parliament.  "
"8423",1997,"Mandela","And allow me to take this opportunity to welcome members of the National Council of Provinces, the living embodiment of co-operative governance. "
"8424",1997,"Mandela","Their presence here already starts to redefine relations between government and the people: not abstract national or regional or local people, but South Africans, requiring and deserving of the highest professional service from their elected representatives.  "
"8425",1997,"Mandela","Last Friday, I had the honour to thank our erstwhile Senators for their service to the nation. "
"8426",1997,"Mandela","I wish to reiterate that today.  "
"8427",1997,"Mandela","At the same time as they infused the debate in these chambers with their unique knowledge and expertise, they were also pioneers at an important moment of creation, the culmination of which is national parliament as we have it today.  "
"8428",1997,"Mandela","The major restructuring of parliament represented by these changes epitomizes the maturing of our democracy. "
"8429",1997,"Mandela","Of no less significance is the process that led to the adoption of the constitution: including mass involvement on the one hand, and the meticulous approach of the Constitutional Court on the other. "
"8430",1997,"Mandela","With each major judgment, this Court grows in stature and places our democracy on a higher pedestal.  "
"8431",1997,"Mandela","Co-operative governance and the New Patriotism also mean a loyal opposition: an opposition that opposes, but remains loyal to the constitution; an opposition that takes part in the major national programmes to reconstruct, to develop, to reconcile, to improve South Africa's standing in the world, to enhance business confidence, to put shoulders to the wheel in the fight against crime: in brief an opposition that takes full part in the efforts to build a better life for all.  "
"8432",1997,"Mandela","We are encouraged that all parties in this chamber have committed themselves to this national consensus.  "
"8433",1997,"Mandela","Through the new constitution, we have laid the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous nation. "
"8434",1997,"Mandela","But it is just that: a foundation. "
"8435",1997,"Mandela","And it will not amount to much if its provisions are not felt in the daily life of our people.  "
"8436",1997,"Mandela","We must and will popularise the constitution. "
"8437",1997,"Mandela","But, above all, we need to act together to implement its provisions.  "
"8438",1997,"Mandela","We can take pride, Madame Speaker, in the fact that, as we enter the last half of this government's mandate, in ail matters of governance, we have laid the foundation to move even more speedily to our nation's goals.  "
"8439",1997,"Mandela","We enter 1997 with all but one locality in the whole country enjoying democratic local governance. "
"8440",1997,"Mandela","The completion of this process during the course of last year was significant not only in the peaceful manner in which it was conducted, but also because a new corps of leaders has emerged, in close touch with the people and steadily but surely starting to make an impact on their lives.  "
"8441",1997,"Mandela","To improve the food security and nutrition of at least the most indigent of the population, projects which amount to R400-million and reaching over a million people were undertaken last year. "
"8442",1997,"Mandela","The Primary School Nutrition Programme now benefits more than 3-million children. "
"8443",1997,"Mandela","Programmes to develop new farming entrepreneurs, to return land to communities and resettle others, and to start tenure reform are starting to change the face of our countryside.  "
"8444",1997,"Mandela","Over 700 000 people have already been supplied with water, and projects are under way which will affect over 6-million citizens.  "
"8445",1997,"Mandela","After two years of preparing the ground, the national housing policy is now fully operational. "
"8446",1997,"Mandela","Today, more houses are in production than at any other time in South Africa's history. "
"8447",1997,"Mandela","Millions now enjoy the benefits of electricity.  "
"8448",1997,"Mandela","Arguably, nowhere else is the fact of democratic transformation felt more keenly than in the area of universal access to health facilities. "
"8449",1997,"Mandela","The building of clinics and hospitals, the immunisation programme and the beginnings of a new drugs policy - all these and more are practical and new qualitative steps that have transformed the majority of South Africans from being neglected outcasts into beneficiaries of a compassionate health policy.  "
"8450",1997,"Mandela","During the course of last year, by dint of hard work by the health ministry, the efforts of relevant community-based organisations and, ironically, the debates around one famous play, the campaign against AIDS was more visibly put on the national agenda. "
"8451",1997,"Mandela","Indeed, it is in part because of South Africa's efforts, that we were invited to take part in the UNAIDS meeting in Davos, Switzeriand just this week.  "
"8452",1997,"Mandela","For the first time in South Africa's history, citizens are starting to benefit from integrated human resource development represented by a non-racial education system, life skills training, financial support to students in tertiary institutions, supply side measures in industry to promote training, and a sports programme based not only on the promotion of healthy lifestyles, but also on constructing facilities in areas that were hitherto neglected.  "
"8453",1997,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  With the estimated 3% growth during the course of last year, the South African economy has turned the comer towards consistent expansion. "
"8454",1997,"Mandela","Beneath this figure, which is of course less than what all of us would prefer, are strong signals of a robust industrial revolution in the making.  "
"8455",1997,"Mandela","This is reflected in the many mega-projects with investments of more than half-a-billion Rand each, a phenomenal growth in fixed investments and improved capacity utilisation in enterprises. "
"8456",1997,"Mandela","The physical volume of production is on a steep rise and so are our manufactured exports. "
"8457",1997,"Mandela","The potential of the tourism industry has started to manifest itself; and in the overall, our balance of payments has started to improve.  "
"8458",1997,"Mandela","We are heartened by the fact that small and medium enterprises can today boast of a government that not only promotes their interests; but one that has in place the structures, the procurement policies and the will to allocate resources to this sector. "
"8459",1997,"Mandela","Be it in the housing programme, the building of roads, the school nutrition programme and public works projects, these entrepreneurs are gradually becoming a critical part of the economic mainstream.  "
"8460",1997,"Mandela","We are confident that the new labour relations legislation, so painstakingly set in motion during the course of last year, will improve the management of this important area. "
"8461",1997,"Mandela","Although no one piece of legislation can be a panacea to our deep social problems, this new regime should temper conflicts at the workplace and help strengthen the partnership between business and labour in national development.  "
"8462",1997,"Mandela","Despite exchange rate pressures, our fiscal and monetary authorities have performed extremely well to ensure that we meet the targeted budget deficit and improve the management of government finances.  "
"8463",1997,"Mandela","In brief, great progress is being made to implement the Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy, itself an achievement in integrated planning introduced last year.  "
"8464",1997,"Mandela","Another such achievement, which is starting to make a difference, is the National Crime Prevention Strategy. "
"8465",1997,"Mandela","Despite the difficulties, despite the fact that such achievements mean little to those who still experience crime, the fact of the matter is that the offensive is on, particularly with regard to most priority crimes. "
"8466",1997,"Mandela","Government is confident of making further progress in the fight for safety, security and stability.  "
"8467",1997,"Mandela","In this regard, the role of the intelligence services deserves special mention. "
"8468",1997,"Mandela","These brave policemen and women and intelligence operatives have made a critical contribution behind the scenes to the success that we have started to register.  "
"8469",1997,"Mandela","We pay tribute to all these dedicated citizens who quite often put their own lives in danger so that we can all lead safe and secure lives.  "
"8470",1997,"Mandela","Indeed, Madame Speaker, we have laid the foundation for a better life.  "
"8471",1997,"Mandela","This is what the Reconstruction and Development Programme is about. "
"8472",1997,"Mandela","The RDP is alive and well. "
"8473",1997,"Mandela","It is not merely a sum of projects but an integrated national programme to improve the nation's quality of life.  "
"8474",1997,"Mandela","But we would be less than candid if we did not acknowledge our shortcomings.  "
"8475",1997,"Mandela","Firstly, because of capacity constraints, some projects could not be undertaken. "
"8476",1997,"Mandela","For instance, a number of provinces have barely spent the funds allocated to them for housing and building of classrooms. "
"8477",1997,"Mandela","It therefore does not make much sense to our people, for us to decry the debt burden and lack of resources while we are unable to utilise even what we have.  "
"8478",1997,"Mandela","Secondly, ordinary citizens continue to complain about practices that have not changed in many government offices. "
"8479",1997,"Mandela","Corruption, including the endemic problem of so-called ""ghost workers"" inherited from the past, continues to bedevil the civil service.  "
"8480",1997,"Mandela","Thirdly, the growth achieved last year was not sufficient to absorb entrants into the labour market.  "
"8481",1997,"Mandela","Lastly, there are increased reports of crimes such as child abuse, rape and domestic violence. "
"8482",1997,"Mandela","In some instances, offenders easily elude our criminal justice system because of a fragmented and ridiculously backward data base.  "
"8483",1997,"Mandela","We can list other examples, not to create despair; but because we are determined to address these shortcomings. "
"8484",1997,"Mandela","This will be a major area of focus in our programme this year.  "
"8485",1997,"Mandela","The primary consideration in this programme is the citizen. "
"8486",1997,"Mandela","For, we can peddle figures of billions allocated to any project; but the question is whether the funds have been spent, and how they have benefited the citizen The people come first; and our models, strategies and plans should be measured by this yardstick.  "
"8487",1997,"Mandela","In a nutshell, the weaknesses we have identified boil down to three things: cooperative governance, management and capacity-building.  "
"8488",1997,"Mandela","In so far as local government is concerned, there is nothing as urgent and as critical as the training of councillors. "
"8489",1997,"Mandela","Their ability to raise funds and manage them, to play their role in the multi-billion housing and infrastructure programmes, to attract investments, to deal with distortions of the apartheid era, and to work with communities in a partnership for development are skills that should be built more intensively this year.  "
"8490",1997,"Mandela","At the same time, amendments will be introduced to the Local Government Transition Act to help stabilise local government finances. "
"8491",1997,"Mandela","While provincial and national government will step in to assist where practicable, progress in this regard will depend on the Masakhane effort to build co-operation between communities and their local representatives.  "
"8492",1997,"Mandela","Closely related to the issue of local government is the matter of traditional leaders. "
"8493",1997,"Mandela","In a number of areas, the social fabric of communities has suffered because of conflict between elected structures and traditional authorities. "
"8494",1997,"Mandela","We will this year intensify interaction with this institution, and we hope to launch the National Council of Traditional Leaders within three months.  "
"8495",1997,"Mandela","This year, in keeping with the spirit of the new constitution, some of the recommendations of the Finance and Fiscal Commission, and consultation between national and provincial structures, a large percentage of the national budget will be allocated globally to the Provinces. "
"8496",1997,"Mandela","This step implies greater responsibility and accountability on the part of the Provinces.  "
"8497",1997,"Mandela","Intense discussions are taking place between national and provincial executive structures. "
"8498",1997,"Mandela","In these consultations, the vexed questions of national minimum standards, national priorities, national norms in spending and a rigorous common system of finance management are being thrashed out; and we are confident that there will be no major hiccups.  "
"8499",1997,"Mandela","In the final analysis, the question is not so much technically what powers and rights this or the other sphere of government has; but what service we can perform and how well we should co-operate in meeting the mandate of building a better life for all.  "
"8500",1997,"Mandela","Closely tied to this is the question whether we are making any headway in transforming the civil service to become a public service in fact.  "
"8501",1997,"Mandela","I wish to congratulate the staff at all levels for their efforts during the trying times of transition. "
"8502",1997,"Mandela","We had to land running. "
"8503",1997,"Mandela","And because significant achievements were made in social delivery, an impression was created that we had found in place a civil service ready to implement the new policies.  "
"8504",1997,"Mandela","From the experience of the Presidential Review Commission, it is quite clear to us that, while work on long-term restructuring of the public service should continue, immediate practical actions are required to speed up the transformation.  "
"8505",1997,"Mandela","From the investigations that the national ministry is conducting in the Provinces, Task Teams will be sent to deal with such weaknesses as personnel records, management of finance, strategic planning and prioritisation, information technology and labour relations.  "
"8506",1997,"Mandela","What may seem simple and straight-forward are precisely the things that require thorough attention. "
"8507",1997,"Mandela","Without this, the danger is as stark as it is real: that we shall not be able to meet the challenges of transforming society.  "
"8508",1997,"Mandela","The Green Paper on Service Delivery has been drafted and the aim is to have legislation in place as soon as is practicable.  "
"8509",1997,"Mandela","At the same time, it has become critical to examine the question of government services which can easily, more cost-effectively and more efficiently be undertaken outside of government. "
"8510",1997,"Mandela","This has to be done with sensitivity, with the interests of the citizen at the centre of our considerations.  "
"8511",1997,"Mandela","I wish to assure the civil service that all these changes will take place on the basis of consultation. "
"8512",1997,"Mandela","The historic agreement reached last year on a new salary and grading system is still in place. "
"8513",1997,"Mandela","Like with all agreements, there were conditions applying to both sides, and government will strive to honour both the spirit and the letter of the agreement. "
"8514",1997,"Mandela","If and when a review is required, this will be pursued on the basis of negotiations.  "
"8515",1997,"Mandela","Indeed, if we do not restructure the service, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to build on the foundation that has been laid.  "
"8516",1997,"Mandela","We shall have good plans and even the resources to carry them out. "
"8517",1997,"Mandela","But we shall year-in and year-out be saddled with unspent funds, terrible services and millions siphoned off in corrupt practices, in callous disregard of the most vulnerable sections of society.  "
"8518",1997,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  The challenges in the areas of safety and security derive also from similar weaknesses.  "
"8519",1997,"Mandela","We need to ensure that when a crime has been prioritised, that emphasis is felt throughout the whole criminal justice system. "
"8520",1997,"Mandela","We should this year establish a comprehensive data base, improve the witness protection programme, empower victims and introduce a new style of work with clear delivery targets and deadlines which must be met. "
"8521",1997,"Mandela","We are also putting in place proper mechanisms of co-ordination among the police, the intelligence community and the prosecutors particularly on crimes that are a national priority.  "
"8522",1997,"Mandela","Further, within the framework of our commitment to the culture of human rights, government is grappling with the issue of bail and appropriate sentences for such serious offences as rape and murder associated with robbery. "
"8523",1997,"Mandela","Legislation on these issues is being drafted. "
"8524",1997,"Mandela","This is being done along with practical measures to improve the investigative capacity of the police.  "
"8525",1997,"Mandela","Let me warn the criminals, especially the car hijackers, the drug syndicates, those who smuggle weapons, corrupt personnel in the criminal justice system, the rapists and child abusers and those involved in taxi violence: we will continue to escalate the offensive against them; we will make their life really difficult this year.  "
"8526",1997,"Mandela","Many of them have been identified and we have examined the ways in which they have been evading the law. "
"8527",1997,"Mandela","We are closing in on them; and we shall demonstrate convincingly that, in our young democracy, crime does not pay!  "
"8528",1997,"Mandela","In the near future, we shall complete the investigation and take steps to cut the number of commercial entry points into the country, including some odd so-called international airports. it is quite clear that the careless attitude of the days of Third Force destabilisation and sanctions-busting is not only providing a heaven for criminals, some of whom were part of these networks; but it is also plainly and simply a threat to national security.  "
"8529",1997,"Mandela","However, when ail is said and done, success depends on our whole society adopting a new value system. "
"8530",1997,"Mandela","For, in many ways, by buying stolen goods, conniving with unscrupulous business-persons to evade tax, allowing criminals to lord it over communities, we do become our own worst enemies.  "
"8531",1997,"Mandela","We also become our own worst enemies by co-operating with forces which commit crimes such as murder and destruction of property, in the name of campaigning against gangs and drugs. "
"8532",1997,"Mandela","We must mobilise against crime yes; but as partners in a law-governed society that respects our legitimate government and other citizens; a law-governed society that does not tolerate illegal occupation of land and houses.  "
"8533",1997,"Mandela","As a result of the tireless efforts of the police, the intelligence community, the national defence force as well as the affected communities and political, religious and business leaders, we have all but eliminated political violence. "
"8534",1997,"Mandela","For this, all these sectors and others must be commended.  "
"8535",1997,"Mandela","Yet with the kind of timing, selection of victims and political rationalisation that are bizarre in the strictest sense of the word, some individuals decided a few weeks ago to use bombs to challenge our democracy. "
"8536",1997,"Mandela","We have examined these dark clouds and we are certain that the storm they threatened to bring has been averted.  "
"8537",1997,"Mandela","Let me reiterate that there is no reason at all for any of our citizens to seek redress through violence. "
"8538",1997,"Mandela","The avenues are there in the constitution and the structures it sets out for airing grievances. "
"8539",1997,"Mandela","It will be the height of folly for anyone to seek to provoke the patience of a people who have elected, against their own deep emotions, to forgive and to reconcile. "
"8540",1997,"Mandela","For their retribution will be decisive and telling.  "
"8541",1997,"Mandela","Honourable Members;  Let me take this opportunity to commend the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for the magnificent work they are doing to realise their mandate. "
"8542",1997,"Mandela","We did not expect their work to be easy. "
"8543",1997,"Mandela","And we are struck by the impact they are making on the national psyche, for theirs is a process that hurts as much as it cleanses.  "
"8544",1997,"Mandela","We are confident that they will be able to meet their deadline; and we hope that the recent decision they and the Freedom Front persuaded us to take on the amnesty deadline will assist in their work. "
"8545",1997,"Mandela","In this regard, and in the interest of an inclusive process, I take this opportunity to place before parliament the recommendation that the cut-off date for amnesty be extended to 10 May 1994.  "
"8546",1997,"Mandela","As it inches towards the truth, the TRC is helping to seal the coffin of a heinous system and to unearth what remnants of the old networks that may still be burrowing in our midst. "
"8547",1997,"Mandela","It is helping to consolidate our democracy; and thus to complement the magnificent work of the Public Protector, the Human Rights Commission and other such institutions.  "
"8548",1997,"Mandela","Another set of institutions critical to the advancement of our society are the Youth and Gender Commissions. "
"8549",1997,"Mandela","We are confident that the Youth Commission will this year start to make its presence felt throughout society, promoting the interests of this precious asset to our nation.  "
"8550",1997,"Mandela","After considering recommendations from parliament, I have accepted the names put forward for the Gender Commission. "
"8551",1997,"Mandela","I wish to congratulate the Chairperson, Thenjiwe Mthintso, and the other Commissioners-designate whose names will be made known in a media statement during the course of the day.  "
"8552",1997,"Mandela","Let me also take this opportunity also to welcome the new Chief Justice of the land, ismail Mahomed; and to assure him and the judiciary that we shall promote their independence and do our bit to make their work easier.  "
"8553",1997,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  We have earlier noted the progress in the implementation of our socio-economic programmes.  "
"8554",1997,"Mandela","During the course of this year we shall further speed up the process of practical implementation. "
"8555",1997,"Mandela","South Africa must become a beehive of communities acting to change their lives for the better.  "
"8556",1997,"Mandela","The nutrition programmes we referred to earlier should reach one-and-a-half million people and a further 2 million school-children. "
"8557",1997,"Mandela","Close on to two-hundred thousand housing units are in line for construction.  18 agricultural ventures should be completed this year to develop new farming entrepreneurs. "
"8558",1997,"Mandela","A further 1 ,7-million people will benefit from the water and sanitation programme; and over two-hundred thousand destitute people in rural areas should be allocated land on which they can live normal lives. "
"8559",1997,"Mandela","More public works programmes will be undertaken especially the rural areas, and the Bill on secure tenure rights should be adopted this year.  "
"8560",1997,"Mandela","I wish to reassure the commercial farming sector that these measures, as well as the proposals on water rights, will be pursued in a manner that does not undermine an industry which is so critical to the nation's food security and exports. "
"8561",1997,"Mandela","At the same time we all know too well that long-term security and productivity in the country-side depend primarily on the upliftment of poor rural communities.  "
"8562",1997,"Mandela","This year, more than 500 clinics will be built or upgraded, and the construction of at least 7 hospitals should commence. "
"8563",1997,"Mandela","We aim in this period to decrease the national backlog in devices for the disabled by 60%; and we will strive to achieve an 80% cure rate for tuberculosis by 1998.  "
"8564",1997,"Mandela","In line with the South African Schools Act, we will start implementing provisions relating to compulsory attendance, a code of conduct for teachers and students and national norms for funding.  "
"8565",1997,"Mandela","A White Paper on Higher Education should have been introduced by the end of the year; and we hope to reach the same number of students with the financial aid scheme as this past year. "
"8566",1997,"Mandela","It should be emphasised that the basic criterion to determine continued assistance will be academic performance.  "
"8567",1997,"Mandela","The restructuring of the welfare system has begun. "
"8568",1997,"Mandela","We will ensure speedy implementation of the decision to attain efficiency, resolve the problem of corruption, and bring more focus on those in acute need, especially unemployed mothers with children under five.  "
"8569",1997,"Mandela","These are just examples of some of the programmes we are committing ourselves to. "
"8570",1997,"Mandela","Within the departments responsible for these programmes, the process of reorienting spending and costing plans on a medium-term basis will continue.  "
"8571",1997,"Mandela","Related to this is a delicate balance that needs to be struck between two extremes: On the one hand, our tender procedures are either not suitable to current needs or they are at times so rigidly applied as to become a break on implementation. "
"8572",1997,"Mandela","On the other hand, there are instances where individuals in authority have ridden roughshod over these procedures, leading to unauthorised expenditure.  "
"8573",1997,"Mandela","These procedures need to be reviewed, in line with the demands of transformation.  "
"8574",1997,"Mandela","The confidence we have regarding these socio-economic commitments derives from the fact that our economic fundamentals are sound. "
"8575",1997,"Mandela","This has given us a firm base from which to achieve higher and sustainable rates of growth and development.  "
"8576",1997,"Mandela","The government's programme to facilitate this positive trend is guided by the critical sign-posts identified in our macro-economic strategy, namely, growth in production for export, infrastructural development, restructuring of state assets, reduction of the budget deficit, human resource development and a comprehensive labour relations dispensation. "
"8577",1997,"Mandela","Critical in all this, is to create jobs and ensure equitable redistribution of wealth.  "
"8578",1997,"Mandela","Our programme this year includes the implementation of the Maputo Development Corridor Initiative in terms of road construction and the other industries, big and small. "
"8579",1997,"Mandela","Similar initiatives will be launched in KwaZulu/Natal and the Eastern Cape.  "
"8580",1997,"Mandela","Investigations are being conducted in the Northern and North-western Provinces; and in all these projects, great care will be exercised to allocate a given percentage to small contractors.  "
"8581",1997,"Mandela","In Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria, Metropolitan Development Initiatives will be launched combining industrial hubs, housing and community centres, roads and other infrastructure. "
"8582",1997,"Mandela","Through these initiatives, we shall start to fundamentally reverse apartheid planning: ensure that workers stay close to their workplaces, and that the racial divide in residential areas is done away with.  "
"8583",1997,"Mandela","The municipal infrastructure programme will see to the implementation of over a thousand projects costing more than a billion Rand; and the gigantic programmes in the telecommunications industry will start to change the lives of millions.  "
"8584",1997,"Mandela","In order to encourage changes in production methods and improve skills training and technology usage, a number of incentives will be put in place during the course of the year. "
"8585",1997,"Mandela","And the tax holiday initiative has become fully operational.  "
"8586",1997,"Mandela","A range of promotional measures and diplomatic initiatives will be undertaken to facilitate exports. "
"8587",1997,"Mandela","At the same time, significant progress is being made to tap foreign capital, as the true potential of the country becomes more and more apparent abroad.  "
"8588",1997,"Mandela","All these elements of our industrial revolution will go a long way to create jobs, and we should start, slowly but surely, to reduce the army of the unemployed.  "
"8589",1997,"Mandela","The macro-economic strategy identifies the restructuring of state assets as a critical part of our programme, to attract investments and technology, ensure efficiency, guarantee affordable prices and reorient state assets towards the goals of reconstruction and development.  "
"8590",1997,"Mandela","In a matter of months, besides the mammoth task of general restructuring, Telkom will acquire a strategic equity partner, and SunAir and Aventura will be wholly privatised. "
"8591",1997,"Mandela","The Airports Company and Safcol (in forestry) should complete their bidding processes this year. "
"8592",1997,"Mandela","Alexkor (in diamond mining) is also being attended to. "
"8593",1997,"Mandela","South African Airways and Autonet should have completed their restructuring processes by the first half of 1998: and intense discussions are under way in Transnet to address these and other subsidiaries.  "
"8594",1997,"Mandela","All these steps will be taken in full consultation with all role-players; and I wish to urge both management and workers to respect this principle.  "
"8595",1997,"Mandela","Our nation should be proud of a trade union movement that has taken active part in the major national debates, and along with business, started to realise co-operative relations in the workplace and in NEDLAC.  "
"8596",1997,"Mandela","But yet on both counts, the trade union movement faces the challenge of unity across racial lines, taking advantage of the opportunities that have opened up and adapting fully to the challenges of the current phase. "
"8597",1997,"Mandela","On the other hand, business has a long way to go with regard to such issues as equity in the workplace and reorienting companies to the developmental needs of the moment.  "
"8598",1997,"Mandela","We hope that this year, negotiations on issues of basic conditions of employments employment equity and the vexed question of a national social agreement will reach some resolution.  "
"8599",1997,"Mandela","As indicated earlier, we are equally optimistic with, regard to issue of government expenditure.  "
"8600",1997,"Mandela","During the course of this year, we shall complete the plans towards medium-term budgeting, in order to bring budget allocations closer to our strategic objectives and to speed up re-prioritisation within departments. "
"8601",1997,"Mandela","We shall also intensify efforts to improve the government's management of cash flows and eliminate unnecessary burdens on the fiscus.  "
"8602",1997,"Mandela","I also wish to emphasise that, in our efforts as government to ensure that the nation lives within its means, we will take into account our mandate to the electorate, particularly the social requirements of the present and the future, and the benefits that will accrue from bold decisions.  "
"8603",1997,"Mandela","The South African Revenue Service should be commended for the improvements in the tax collection system. "
"8604",1997,"Mandela","We are however concerned that many people are not meeting their tax obligations, and as such, the tax burden is borne by too few honest citizens.  "
"8605",1997,"Mandela","It is fair to assume that we all want the programmes outlined above to materialise; that we all want South Africa to succeed. "
"8606",1997,"Mandela","But we must be prepared to foot the bill for success.  "
"8607",1997,"Mandela","To broaden the tax base and break the culture of non-payment, we have offered certain relief measures which expire on 28 February this year. "
"8608",1997,"Mandela","All persons who qualify are again urged to make US8 of this opportunity. "
"8609",1997,"Mandela","Those who have not responded should be assured that, after this, will be the knock of the tax-man and woman, backed by the full force of the law.  "
"8610",1997,"Mandela","In the overall, we are confident that we have moved into high gear in the implementation of the macro-economic strategy.  "
"8611",1997,"Mandela","I would also like to reaffirm our commitment to the phased removal of remaining exchange controls.  "
"8612",1997,"Mandela","We appreciate the new surge among all sectors to promote South Africa's true qualities abroad. "
"8613",1997,"Mandela","This has already helped improve the economic environment, and, with the co-operation of all, it can only get better.  "
"8614",1997,"Mandela","I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the South African National Defence Force for its continuing contribution to the maintenance of our country's integrity, for the assistance it has rendered to the police in combating crime and dealing with natural disasters, and for the speed with which it has taken up the challenge to prepare for active peace-keeping tasks that we may be called upon to undertake.  "
"8615",1997,"Mandela","The integration process and development of new doctrines have proceeded fairly well. "
"8616",1997,"Mandela","But we cannot claim that the process has been flawless. "
"8617",1997,"Mandela","The challenge is for the former statutory forces to embrace change and to eschew the temptation to maintain the status quo. "
"8618",1997,"Mandela","It is for the former non-statutory forces to utilise the positions they hold to help speed up transformation and not shy away from responsibilities at the slightest hint of difficulties.  "
"8619",1997,"Mandela","Debate will continue this year on the White Paper and the Defence Review, but what is critical is to move towards practical implementation. "
"8620",1997,"Mandela","One of the issues in this regard is the defence force's requirements for equipment. "
"8621",1997,"Mandela","The question here is not whether, but how to meet these requirements and how much the country can afford. "
"8622",1997,"Mandela","As Commander-ln-Chief, I wish to emphasise that we shall not shirk our responsibility to the defence force.  "
"8623",1997,"Mandela","We are confident that out of all these efforts we shall strengthen our unity as a nation.  "
"8624",1997,"Mandela","But this will also depend on the ability of government to communicate clearly, coherently and professionally, as well as the preparedness of the media to transmit and interpret our actions and omissions in a professional, objective and fair manner. "
"8625",1997,"Mandela","The government welcomes the report of the Communications Task Group and its recommendations are being processed for implementation.  "
"8626",1997,"Mandela","As we improve South Africa's communications, including in the areas of culture, film, monuments and other media; as we mature to understand one another better, and as we join hands to improve our quality of life, we shall at the same time be building a nation ready for the challenges of the next millennium.  "
"8627",1997,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  Our young democracy is still grappling with the challenge of its positioning in the international milieu.  "
"8628",1997,"Mandela","It is understandable that at times this debate will be heated and acrimonious; because it is a debate more than just about how we relate to the world. "
"8629",1997,"Mandela","It is part of the process of defining who we are. "
"8630",1997,"Mandela","It is part of the resolution of past divisions within South African society - divisions which informed our divergent views of the world.  "
"8631",1997,"Mandela","Within the Southern African Development Community, the first steps have been taken towards a free trade area within 8 years. "
"8632",1997,"Mandela","Historic initiatives exemplified by the Maputo Development Corridor are gradually going to become the norm, as we bring our collective strength to bear to meet common challenges. "
"8633",1997,"Mandela","It is a measure of our collective destiny that even bilateral negotiations between ourselves and the European Community had to be underpinned by regional realities.  "
"8634",1997,"Mandela","Welcome progress was made in bilateral trade arrangements with Zimbabwe, and we aim to move faster this year to complete negotiations on the Customs Union.  "
"8635",1997,"Mandela","We were honoured last year to be elected as Chairperson of the SADC for three years; and we will continue to work to strengthen the Community and enhance its standing in Africa and abroad.  "
"8636",1997,"Mandela","In this context, we shall continue to make our humble contribution to the resolution of the crisis in the Great Lakes Region and to assist in facilitating the peace process in Angola.  "
"8637",1997,"Mandela","Over the past year, we strengthened our relations with countries such as India and others in Asia, Brazil and others in Latin America, Saudi Arabia and others in the Middle East.We are all only starting to appreciate the full meaning of these relations in terms of exports, opportunities for investments and sources of capital. "
"8638",1997,"Mandela","And evolving quietly from this, is a special relationship that is more or less natural among countries with broadly the same level of development, socio-economic challenges and interests.  "
"8639",1997,"Mandela","How this will impact on South-South co-operation, assist in redefining the world balance of forces and enhance the unique potential of each of the countries, are matters that still require further examination.  "
"8640",1997,"Mandela","Our commitment to the strengthening of the Organisation of African Unity is a matter of course. "
"8641",1997,"Mandela","We also wish to congratulate UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan and offer our co-operation as this august body restructures itself. "
"8642",1997,"Mandela","As President of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, we will continue to contribute to building the bridges of co-operation between the North and the South. "
"8643",1997,"Mandela","We shall also start in earnest this year to prepare for the next Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement which we shall be honoured to host in 1998.  "
"8644",1997,"Mandela","In the next few days, we shall play host to the King of Sweden as well as the Vice-President of the United States of America. "
"8645",1997,"Mandela","These visits epitomise the intimate relations we have forged across the spectrum before and since our democratic elections. "
"8646",1997,"Mandela","Bi-national Commissions with the US, Russia and the Federal Republic of Germany, and our special relations with countries of Northern and Western Europe, Japan and others speak of the positive climate that we have, to pursue South Africa's interests, which are in many respects the interests of the majority of the world's peoples.  "
"8647",1997,"Mandela","We shall not falter in our contribution to the resolution of conflict and promotion of peace throughout the world. "
"8648",1997,"Mandela","In this context, and in the context of our own principles, we shall continue to approach the issue of the manufacture and sale of weapons with circumspection. "
"8649",1997,"Mandela","And as in everything else we do, we shall always defend our right as a nation independently to take decisions.  "
"8650",1997,"Mandela","Honourable Members;  In all areas of endeavour, we have laid the foundation for success. "
"8651",1997,"Mandela","At work, in sport and leisure, in business and the professions, in the schools and places of worship, we are forging a resilient nation; a nation conscious of its responsibilities to itself, to future generations and to the world in which we live.  "
"8652",1997,"Mandela","The government has got the practical programmes in place to contribute decisively to the attainment of the nation's objectives. "
"8653",1997,"Mandela","At the same time as we intensify the implementation of reconstruction and development, we shall improve co-operative governance as well as capacity and management at all levels.  "
"8654",1997,"Mandela","The foundation for a better life has been laid. "
"8655",1997,"Mandela","In the spirit of the New Patriotism, we can only rise to new heights."
"8656",1996,"Mandela"," Honourable President and Deputy President of the Senate; Honourable Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly; Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly; Deputy Presidents, Minister and Deputy Minister; Provincial Premiers; Chief Justice; President of the Constitutional Court; Leaders of our Security Services; Directors-General and leaders of the public service; Honourable Members of Parliament; Distinguished guests; Ladies and gentlemen;  Today in the streets of Johannesburg, the New Patriotism of our new democracy once again asserts itself as citizens of that city express their appreciation for the feat of our soccer team in the African Nations Cup. "
"8657",1996,"Mandela","This is bound to replay itself in other cities, adding to the crowning glory of our rugby world champions.  "
"8658",1996,"Mandela","Our sports-persons are performing beyond the nation's wildest expectations. "
"8659",1996,"Mandela","On and off the field, they are uniting our nation like never before, by their determination to do the best for their country.  "
"8660",1996,"Mandela","Such is the true character of South Africans. "
"8661",1996,"Mandela","We do possess the inner strength to achieve excellence. "
"8662",1996,"Mandela","We have the will to persevere against all odds.  "
"8663",1996,"Mandela","We enter 1996, as Cabinet and the rest of the Executive, as parliamentarians, as workers and managers, as professionals, traditional leaders, security forces, students and communities in general, faced with the challenge of bringing these positive qualities to beat on every thing we do: to make South Africa a winning nation.  "
"8664",1996,"Mandela","We must bring out the best in all of us; and, like our sports-persons, perform better everywhere:  to expand the economy and create jobs;  to improve the quality of life for all;  to expand the frontiers of freedom; and  to ensure comprehensive security for all citizens.  "
"8665",1996,"Mandela","These are the critical challenges that we face within and outside these hallowed chambers.  "
"8666",1996,"Mandela","In October this year, we shall pass the half-way mark of the present legislature and its executive. "
"8667",1996,"Mandela","The nation and the world will judge us not on whether we mean to do good; but, above all, on whether we have mobilised south Africans to work together to improve their quality of life.  "
"8668",1996,"Mandela","Indeed, Madame Speaker, we can say with confidence that, steadily but surely, the great majority of South Africans do feel that things are improving for the better. "
"8669",1996,"Mandela","We are on our way South Africa is on its way to a better future.  "
"8670",1996,"Mandela","Life has started to have real meaning for the hundreds of thousands who now have access to clean and safe drinking water. "
"8671",1996,"Mandela","The benefits of democracy have a tangible impact for the 400000 homes which have been supplied with electricity during the course of last year. "
"8672",1996,"Mandela","To the millions of children who benefit from the school nutrition scheme, free medical care and free and compulsory education, not only has the present become better; there is also great confidence in the future.  "
"8673",1996,"Mandela","This is the case with communities where the clinic-building programme and the district health system are taking root; the workers in Public Works Programmes; the communities who can, at least, feel secure on a piece of land they can call their own; and the families who, for the first time, are benefiting from the farmer support programme and extension of agricultural credit.  "
"8674",1996,"Mandela","At last, millions who had no hope in the future can look ahead with confidence in the full knowledge that they have a government prepared to work together with them to build a better life for all.  "
"8675",1996,"Mandela","We formally start the third session of the democratic parliament with South Africa's economy healthier than in many decades. "
"8676",1996,"Mandela","The rekindling of business confidence and optimism reflect the solid foundation on which the economic upswing is based. "
"8677",1996,"Mandela","The expansion of the manufacturing sector, phenomenal growth in fixed investments and large capital inflows hold out a promise for a durable recovery and the potential for an even better performance.  "
"8678",1996,"Mandela","We enter 1996 with no hesitation about the extent to which democracy has taken root in our society.  "
"8679",1996,"Mandela","The confidence of the population in the democratic process was again shown during the Local Government elections.  "
"8680",1996,"Mandela","At the same time, the institutions charged with safeguarding constitutional freedoms such as the Human Rights commission, the Land Commission, and the Office of the Public Protector have been formed. "
"8681",1996,"Mandela","The Constitutional Court has, in its one year of existence, firmly asserted itself as an independent, impartial and authorita- tive guardian of the Constitution. "
"8682",1996,"Mandela","In brief, South African politics is ascending to the level of normalcy, where civilised standards of political relations will be entrenched, unmediated by antagonistic conflict or administrative interventions.  "
"8683",1996,"Mandela","The progress we have made, across the board, is a result, in great measure, of the intervention of Honourable Members gathered here and the provincial legislators, in setting the parameters and direction of transformation; in your devoted the citizenry.  performance of these elected institutions. "
"8684",1996,"Mandela","Our legislatures are, in the first instance, the custodians of the new system, and, secondly, the bodies through which the programme of reconstruction and development, nation-building and reconciliation, can and should be codified and turned into a living reality.  "
"8685",1996,"Mandela","Yes, South Africa is not only on the right road. "
"8686",1996,"Mandela","We are well on our way to making this the country of our dreams. "
"8687",1996,"Mandela","I take the opportunity to congratulate all South Africans, in the public and private sectors the most prominent in the land as well as the humble member of the community all of whom are striving to add another brick to the edifice of our democracy. "
"8688",1996,"Mandela","We have set out on this road together, and we should together aim for the stars.  "
"8689",1996,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  If these achievements are something to be proud of, this is because they have laid the foundation to make a real impact on the inequities of the past. "
"8690",1996,"Mandela","For we are only at the beginning of a long journey, a journey we should undertake with expedition, if our con- sciences are not impervious to the cries of desperation of millions. "
"8691",1996,"Mandela","But this is a journey, too, that requires thorough planning and tenacious industry, if we are to remain on course and capable of sustaining our march.  "
"8692",1996,"Mandela","Let me preface the identification of the challenges of the coming year by saying that all of us, all South Africans, are called upon to become builders and healers. "
"8693",1996,"Mandela","But, for all the joy and excitement of creation, to build and to heal are difficult undertakings.  "
"8694",1996,"Mandela","We can neither heal nor build, if such healing and building are perceived as one-way process, with the victims of past injustices forgiving and the beneficiaries merely content in gratitude. "
"8695",1996,"Mandela","Together we must set out to correct the defects of the past.  "
"8696",1996,"Mandela","We can neither heal nor build, if on the one hand, the rich in our society see the poor as hordes of irritants; or if, on the other hand, the poor sit back, expecting charity. "
"8697",1996,"Mandela","All of us must take responsibility for the upliftment of our conditions, prepared to give our best to the benefit of all.  "
"8698",1996,"Mandela","We can neither heal nor build, if we continue to have people in positions of influence and power who, at best, pay lip service to affirmative action, black empowerment and the emancipation of women, or who are, in reality, opposed to these goals; if we have people who continue with blind arrogance to practice racism in the work-places and schools, despite the appeal we made in our very first address to this parliament. "
"8699",1996,"Mandela","We must work together to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth, opportunity and power in our society.  "
"8700",1996,"Mandela","We cannot build or heal our nation, if in both the private and public sectors, in the schools and universities, in the hospi- tals and on the land, in dealing with crime and social dislocation if we continue with business as usual, wallowing in notions of the past. "
"8701",1996,"Mandela","Everywhere and in everything we do, what is now required is boldness in thinking, firmness in resolve and consistency in action.  "
"8702",1996,"Mandela","The message I am trying to convey is that all of us must take the national project of accelerated and fundamental transformation of our country very seriously indeed. "
"8703",1996,"Mandela","The achievement of the objectives of equity, non-racialism and non-sexism constitute the very essence of the new society we seek to build.  "
"8704",1996,"Mandela","In the history of nations, generations have made their mark through their acumen to appreciate critical turning points, and with determination and creativity, to seize the moment. "
"8705",1996,"Mandela","South Africa is well on its way to a new and better life. "
"8706",1996,"Mandela","This we will achieve only if we shed the temptation to proceed casually along th road; only if we fully take the opportunities that beckon.  "
"8707",1996,"Mandela","We must unite in a New Patriotism to achieve the goal of creating a new society.  "
"8708",1996,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  The potential for economic growth and development are better than in many decades. "
"8709",1996,"Mandela","But let us be brutally frank.  "
"8710",1996,"Mandela","Despite the welcome rate of growth, very few jobs have been created. "
"8711",1996,"Mandela","In fact, against the backdrop of new entrants into the job market, there has been a shrinkage in opportunities. "
"8712",1996,"Mandela","We need a national vision to lift us out of this quagmire.  "
"8713",1996,"Mandela","If we do not act together in the public and private sectors to develop and implement such a national strategic vision, the danger is that even the modest growth we have attained, will peter out in a matter of a few years, as the strain of limited capacity, skills shortage, balance of payments and other constraints start to gather momentum; and as increasing unemployment and accelerating poverty bear down on our society.  "
"8714",1996,"Mandela","To move forward with purpose requires that we extricate the public and private sectors from the current comfort zones, and break through the threshold to achieve a rate of growth sufficient to create jobs, and generate resources for rapid socio-economic programmes to uplift the poor.  "
"8715",1996,"Mandela","For purposes of emphasis, let me identify three important investment challenges and attendant difficult choices that have to be made.  "
"8716",1996,"Mandela","Firstly, we require major investment in infrastructure, including such areas as municipal services, housing and construction and telecommunications in order to create jobs at the same time as we improve services to the citizenry. "
"8717",1996,"Mandela","As we enter these areas in a decisive manner, the question will arise, over and over again, whether we can attain our objective, if the profit motive is the only dynamo of our actions!  "
"8718",1996,"Mandela","Secondly, we need investment and restructuring of manufacturing and other industries such as tourism, agriculture and mining, which are critical for export and foreign exchange earnings. "
"8719",1996,"Mandela","Related to this, for instance, is the challenge whether we can continue with the same structure of our agricultural industry given our capricious climatic conditions!  "
"8720",1996,"Mandela","Thirdly, none of the economic objectives we aspire to can be realised without massive investment in people. "
"8721",1996,"Mandela","I refer here to questions of skills development, adult education, and the overhaul of our entire education system, as well as health and other services, which I will return to later. "
"8722",1996,"Mandela","Indeed, as we struggle to widen the skills base and to absorb more people into the economy, the challenge will continue to face organised labour and the employed in general, including the managers: can we succeed if we premise our actions narrowly on the interests of those who are already economically engaged!  "
"8723",1996,"Mandela","When all is said and done, we return again to the challenge of a New South African patriotism: that at the end of each day everyone of us should afford a smile in his or her face, when we pose to ourselves the question: what have I done today to create jobs and improve my skills and those of others!  "
"8724",1996,"Mandela","As Government, we fully acknowledge the critical role that we need to play in realising the vision of growth and development.  "
"8725",1996,"Mandela","I wish to emphasise that, over the past year, Government has moved to a new level of co-ordination that is unprecedented in the history of our country. "
"8726",1996,"Mandela","It is quite clear to us, that success in achieving the growth and development objectives we have identified requires integration of planning and operations across departments and provinces. "
"8727",1996,"Mandela","Important cross-sectoral meetings and inter-govern- mental forums are being held to elaborate the growth and development strategy and the institutional mechanisms required to drive it.  "
"8728",1996,"Mandela","I should personally make the observation that we are finally succeeding in galvanising Government to give effective leadership to economic growth and development. "
"8729",1996,"Mandela","Within weeks, we should be able to make major announcements on the progress made.  "
"8730",1996,"Mandela","In order to improve the investment climate, our monetary authorities are reviewing, on an on-going basis, the timing and pace of lifting existing exchange controls. "
"8731",1996,"Mandela","For us, it is not a matter of whether, but of when, these controls will be phased out.  "
"8732",1996,"Mandela","It is critical, if we have to promote competitiveness, export and the creation of jobs, that we should have in place the necessary supply-side measures. "
"8733",1996,"Mandela","Already consensus is being reached in NEDLAC about the required incentives that will help boost training, pro- ductivity, work organisation and investment in particular industries and regions. "
"8734",1996,"Mandela","Arguably, the most important measures in this regard pertain to the development of small and medium-sized businesses.  "
"8735",1996,"Mandela","Relevant legislation on these issues, as well as the critical question of competitive practices in the economy, should come before parliament during the course of this session.  "
"8736",1996,"Mandela","I am convinced that the various role-players in the economy have long passed questioning the need or otherwise for such competitive practices, and the long-term benefits this will bring to the economy, including big and small companies. "
"8737",1996,"Mandela","I hope, too, that legislation on employment equity and standards will be passed in this session, with the support of all relevant stake-holders.  "
"8738",1996,"Mandela","This should also be the case with the restructuring of public assets, in order to use them to accelerate growth and development, attune them with modern levels of technology, reorganise them to expand services to all citizens, and reshape them in line with the imperatives of internal democracy.  "
"8739",1996,"Mandela","It was to be expected, that such a massive undertaking should generate much debate among the public and the working class, in particular. "
"8740",1996,"Mandela","What is clear, though, is that there was a breakdown of communication, which precipitated unnecessary acrimony on an issue that should enjoy the support of all interested parties. "
"8741",1996,"Mandela","I am happy that the National Framework Agreement, negotiated between Government and the Trade Unions, was adopted by Cabinet two days ago.  "
"8742",1996,"Mandela","Therefore, the government's relationship with labour, from the level of the executive as a whole, to the departments and the management of public enterprises, must be set on a viable footing to ensure co-operative rather than confrontational interaction. "
"8743",1996,"Mandela","We are confident that the restructuring programme will be carried out with due speed - and carried out in a manner that involves and benefits all stake-holders.  "
"8744",1996,"Mandela","Madame Speaker and Honourable Members;  It is the firm view of the Government of National Unity that the growth and development strategy should be pursued in an integrated manner. "
"8745",1996,"Mandela","We do not subscribe to the notion that growth on its own can rectify the backlogs of apartheid in a mysterious trickle-down fashion. "
"8746",1996,"Mandela","In any case, in our skewed social structure, there cannot be growth without development.  areas of development that protect and improve our human resources.  "
"8747",1996,"Mandela","Four important areas identify themselves for special mention.  "
"8748",1996,"Mandela","The first area is education. "
"8749",1996,"Mandela","On this the 20th anniversary of the Students' Uprising and the OAU-declared Year of Education in Africa, we face the stark reality that South Africa lags behind many African countries in so far as literacy and other human development indicators are concerned.  "
"8750",1996,"Mandela","We owe it to that corps of brave young people who rose up against the apartheid system to institute further measures this year, decisively to move towards a non-racial, democratic and equitable education system. "
"8751",1996,"Mandela","If anything, the Matric results last year, and the reality of children, in the Northern Province and elsewhere, whose classes have to scatter in disarray at the first signs of rain, are a stark reminder of how far we still are from that goal.  "
"8752",1996,"Mandela","Clearly, rectifying these imbalances will require redistribution of the limited resources among races and Provinces. "
"8753",1996,"Mandela","It will also require even greater commitment to teach and to learn from teachers and students alike. "
"8754",1996,"Mandela","And I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them as well as the parents for the stability that has set in, in our institutions of learning.  "
"8755",1996,"Mandela","Two days ago, Cabinet adopted the White Paper on education. "
"8756",1996,"Mandela","The centre-piece of such restructuring should be the establishment of a quality-driven public school system available to all South African children. "
"8757",1996,"Mandela","Among other things that should drive this, is democratic governance involving parents, teachers and students at secondary level, a curriculum and career-guidance scheme that are more appropriate to the needs of the country, and community involvement. "
"8758",1996,"Mandela","Adult Basic Education and Early  At university and technikon levels, it is necessary that the debate on transformation starts in earnest in an organised manner, so that policy positions can emerge to guide these autonomous institutions.  "
"8759",1996,"Mandela","As one measure of our commitment to tackle the backlogs in the building of schools, R1-billion has been allocated for this purpose. "
"8760",1996,"Mandela","A further R300-million has been set aside for a student financing support scheme for universities and technikons.  "
"8761",1996,"Mandela","The matter of retrenchment of teachers has once again arisen, though in a sensational and unfortunate manner. "
"8762",1996,"Mandela","Today, I once more wish to reassure teachers that this government is committed to re-deploy rather than retrench teachers. "
"8763",1996,"Mandela","Any other approach would not make sense, given the needs in many parts of the country. "
"8764",1996,"Mandela","This process itself will be the subject of extensive consultation, and only in extreme cases, will the possibility of retrenchment be considered.  "
"8765",1996,"Mandela","I hope that this year will see co-operation among all parties in these chambers to facilitate educational reform. "
"8766",1996,"Mandela","Pronouncements about economic growth sound hollow, if they are followed up by attempts to block, by hook or by crook, legislation meant to equip children with the required skills. "
"8767",1996,"Mandela","Declarations of loyalty to democracy can only be but mere words, if in actual practice, people are seen to defend islands of white privilege.  "
"8768",1996,"Mandela","The second important area is health delivery. "
"8769",1996,"Mandela","Many steps have been taken to introduce a new health policy based, principally, on greatly expanding the primary health care system. "
"8770",1996,"Mandela","The clinic-build- ing programme often seems insignificant by the standards of those who have resources in abundance. "
"8771",1996,"Mandela","But, in the rural areas and sprawling urban settlements, this is a matter, literally, of life and death. "
"8772",1996,"Mandela","It is therefore of great significance that we have moved from the planning stages to actual implementation.  "
"8773",1996,"Mandela","During the course of last year, many ugly incidents took place which brought to the fore the terrible conditions under which health workers operate. "
"8774",1996,"Mandela","Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to them, for their selfless service to communities. "
"8775",1996,"Mandela","While we strongly disapprove of some of these incidents, we fully appreciate their plight. "
"8776",1996,"Mandela","Discussions are at an advanced stage to formulate a new grading system and avail incentives, especially in rural areas. "
"8777",1996,"Mandela","Like with all other professions, we value very highly the services of doctors and other health workers; and we shall do our best to ensure their security.  "
"8778",1996,"Mandela","I should once more emphasise the need for a massive education campaign on the AIDS epidemic, and commend the relevant ministries for the work they are doing in this regard. "
"8779",1996,"Mandela","We dare remind our- selves, that all the objectives we outline here, will not be pos- sible to attain, if the AIDS epidemic is not brought under control.  policy and implementation. "
"8780",1996,"Mandela","It is a matter of common knowledge - painfully common to those without housing - that many constraints have bedevilled the proper implementation of this programme. "
"8781",1996,"Mandela","But the staying power of this democratic government is its preparedness to acknowledge weaknesses and strive to rectify them. "
"8782",1996,"Mandela","Such is the quality of the minister and staff, that they have critically and openly examined these problems, and identified corrective measures.  "
"8783",1996,"Mandela","What is clear from their decisions, is that we need, not one, but many integrated campaigns to deal with the housing problem. "
"8784",1996,"Mandela","These include:  greater commitment on the part of financial institutions to allocate resources to poor areas; and  firm indications from communities that the rent and service boycotts have, in the spirit of Masakhane, come to an end.  "
"8785",1996,"Mandela","Over and above these issues, we cannot over emphasise the centrality particularly of Local Government in the housing programme, the provision of infrastructure and related campaigns. "
"8786",1996,"Mandela","We also need to examine the pertinent question of the integration of our cities. "
"8787",1996,"Mandela","Too many of the low-cost housing initiatives are mere additions to apartheid's black townships, saddled with the same problems of distance from workplaces and lack of proper community facilities. "
"8788",1996,"Mandela","To address this will require a creative approach, among others, to the question of residential densities, which will also help to reduce infrastructural costs, including those related to public transport.  "
"8789",1996,"Mandela","The fourth area pertains to land reform. "
"8790",1996,"Mandela","I am certain that all of us welcome the passing of the Bill on security of tenure and the launch last week of the Green Paper on land reform. "
"8791",1996,"Mandela","When finalised, the policies adopted will form an important part of our rural development strategy. "
"8792",1996,"Mandela","For the first time in centuries, families turned into insecure sojourners in the land of their birth, can talk of real security.  "
"8793",1996,"Mandela","Soon, the Land Claims Court will begin its work; and we are confident that it will deal with the complex problems in a manner that ensures justice and promotes the agricultural interests of the country. "
"8794",1996,"Mandela","No one has reason to fear: the aim of government is to build, not to destroy.  "
"8795",1996,"Mandela","In these four areas of our socio-economic programmes and others, what is required is a partnership among all sectors: communities, government and the private sector. "
"8796",1996,"Mandela","Thus, when we talk of the New Patriotism, we are talking also of efforts of communities to build one another and together build their future. "
"8797",1996,"Mandela","We are talking of Masakhane!  "
"8798",1996,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  The question needs to be posed, whether we do indeed have a state machinery capable of meeting the objectives of growth and development!  "
"8799",1996,"Mandela","I should start off by thanking all Ministers, the Public Service Commission and heads of department sincerely for their efforts in this difficult transitional period. "
"8800",1996,"Mandela","Steadily, progress is being registered in making the Public Service broadly representative of society. "
"8801",1996,"Mandela","From a trifle of 6%, today black managers constitute 37% of this echelon. "
"8802",1996,"Mandela","From less than 5%, females now constitute 10% of management. "
"8803",1996,"Mandela","Progress, yes - but not nearly enough.  "
"8804",1996,"Mandela","The Public Service Commission has placed on the table a new salary and grading system, which contains within it the potential to redress past inequalities, stabilise labour relations and promote reform of the Service. "
"8805",1996,"Mandela","Government supports this proposal in principle, and discussions are continuing on ways of financing it. "
"8806",1996,"Mandela","We are confident that, when finalised, the White Paper and legislation will enjoy the support of workers and managers alike, all of whom will have fully participated in their formulation.  "
"8807",1996,"Mandela","Yet, all this does not resolve some of the complex and immediate problems arising from the apartheid past.  "
"8808",1996,"Mandela","Let us remind ourselves of this government's mandate which is to establish a single, streamlined, efficient and transparent Public Service and to allocate more public resources to capital expenditure. "
"8809",1996,"Mandela","Let us be frank and say that the current service is too large, and it has to be rationalised. "
"8810",1996,"Mandela","There is no other option.  "
"8811",1996,"Mandela","However, our actions cannot ignore the painful truth that the most affected will be areas that are poor, with low economic activity and little prospect for alternative employment. "
"8812",1996,"Mandela","This means, among other things, searching for creative negotiated solutions that will help stimulate economic activity.  "
"8813",1996,"Mandela","The rationalisation process will not be vindictive. "
"8814",1996,"Mandela","Neither will it be carried out in a haphazard manner. "
"8815",1996,"Mandela","Rather, it will affect all races and provinces. "
"8816",1996,"Mandela","Discussion are well advanced with the relevant ministry to set up the Presidential Review Commission which will redefine the structure, functions and procedures of the Public Service, and relevant announcements can be expected soon.  "
"8817",1996,"Mandela","Among the greatest challenges for 1996 is to further build the capacity of government to serve communities. "
"8818",1996,"Mandela","Nowhere is this needed more than at local level, where government interacts on a daily basis with communities. "
"8819",1996,"Mandela","It should therefore be the case that one of the main themes of this year will be the introduction of massive training programmes for the newly-elected councillors and their staff.  "
"8820",1996,"Mandela","Local Government must be given the necessary capacity not only to handle finances and render efficient and affordable services. "
"8821",1996,"Mandela","It is critical that accountability and mobilisation of communities should also form part of their ethos. "
"8822",1996,"Mandela","This, elected officials at local level should know, that, in the final analysis, nation- building and reconciliation, economic growth and development, will depend largely on the performance of local councils.  "
"8823",1996,"Mandela","Despite predictions to the contrary, the people showed their confidence in the new democracy, and re-affirmed their mandate to the Government of National Unite in the November elections. "
"8824",1996,"Mandela","Our task, at all levels, is to justify that trust and confidence by mobilising them to work together for an improvement in their conditions of life. "
"8825",1996,"Mandela","It is part of that mandate to ensure that there is co-operative governance among all tiers; so that national, provincial and local governments complement one another.  "
"8826",1996,"Mandela","In KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Western Cape, where local elections will take place in May, we expect and should work for, campaigns that are free of violence and intimidation, campaigns which promote unity in our diversity. "
"8827",1996,"Mandela","We hope that all the parties, within, and-outside this chamber, will openly commit themselves to the conduct of free and fair elections.  "
"8828",1996,"Mandela","Honourable Members;  The national effort to improve the quality of life of the people means also that each citizen and each community should enjoy security in the home, at work and in the streets.  "
"8829",1996,"Mandela","We believe that it has now dawned on all present here, that dealing with crime and violence requires a comprehensive strategy and hard work, rather than just injunctions from election platforms.  "
"8830",1996,"Mandela","I am happy to announce that Cabinet will soon unveil the National Crime Prevention Strategy for public comment. "
"8831",1996,"Mandela","This strategy brings together the combined efforts of the police, judiciary and prison authorities in an effective criminal justice system. "
"8832",1996,"Mandela","The aim is not only to improve the capacity of police to prevent crime and apprehend criminals; but it is also to ensure that they are dealt with to the full extent of the law, and properly rehabilitated.  "
"8833",1996,"Mandela","We commend the business community for the campaign they have launched against crime and corruption. "
"8834",1996,"Mandela","Some of the practical steps that they have taken are starting to bear fruit; and the many proposals from their Conference will form part of the Strategy we have referred to. "
"8835",1996,"Mandela","Within communities, co-operation with the police is improving by the day, with positive results.  "
"8836",1996,"Mandela","No one can doubt the commitment of the South African Police Service to deal with crime. "
"8837",1996,"Mandela","And we pay tribute to them for daily putting their lives in danger in the service of their country. "
"8838",1996,"Mandela","Great progress has been made in transforming this institution, integrating the various services, introducing civilian oversight and ensuring professionalism in their operations.  "
"8839",1996,"Mandela","The dedication with which the leadership of the Service has gone about rooting out corruption, and taking the war to the syndicates and other criminals, should be commended. "
"8840",1996,"Mandela","And the abiding lesson from their successes is that this can only be accomplished with the co-operation of communities and individual citizens.  "
"8841",1996,"Mandela","We should also remind ourselves, over and over again, that crime constitutes more than just drug trafficking and car hijacking. "
"8842",1996,"Mandela","When tons and tons of vegetables disappear without trace in a city council depot, this is criminal conduct of the worst order. "
"8843",1996,"Mandela","When billions are siphoned off from companies and out of the country, this is criminal robbery of the nation's resources. "
"8844",1996,"Mandela","When food and funds meant for school children are stolen, this is criminal plunder against our children and our future.  "
"8845",1996,"Mandela","A particular feature of crime in our country is the violence afflicting KwaZulu-Natal, the taxi industry as well as bizarre incidents of gang warfare and other murders. "
"8846",1996,"Mandela","By any name and under any guise, this is criminal conduct; and it should be dealt with as such.  incidents in the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, where individuals have organised themselves to undermine, physically and otherwise, investigations into the murders which took place over the holiday period. "
"8847",1996,"Mandela","Armed with an assortment of weapons, they have taken it upon themselves, in full view of the public media, to challenge the nation's law-enforcement agencies.  "
"8848",1996,"Mandela","I am today issuing a strong warning to these elements, that this cannot be allowed to continue. "
"8849",1996,"Mandela","The time has come for our nation to choose whether we want to become a law-governed and peaceful society or hapless hostages of lawlessness. "
"8850",1996,"Mandela","I have discussed this matter with the Ministry and the leadership of the Police Service, and they have assured me that strong action will be taken.  "
"8851",1996,"Mandela","In addition to this, I wish to announce today, that preparations are under way to introduce measures that will prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public manifestations. "
"8852",1996,"Mandela","No one, irrespective of organisations to which they may belong, will be exempted from these measures.  "
"8853",1996,"Mandela","Dealing with crime, violence and corruption requires a new morality for our new nation. "
"8854",1996,"Mandela","Indeed, it requires a new Patriotism among communities, the public and private sectors, and the security services - so that at the end of each day, each one of us can answer in the affirmative the question: have I done something today, to stamp out crime!  "
"8855",1996,"Mandela","The performance of the nation against crime depends heavily on the intelligence capacity of the security services as a whole. "
"8856",1996,"Mandela","On this, depends also the security of our democracy. "
"8857",1996,"Mandela","And I should pay tribute to the unsung heroes in the intelligence community who are contributing immensely to our successes in this regard.  "
"8858",1996,"Mandela","I also wish to reiterate the government's commitment to protect the rights of privacy and ensure the security of all individuals in public service as well as other citizens. "
"8859",1996,"Mandela","This is the code of conduct which guides all our security services.  "
"8860",1996,"Mandela","However, in plying their dubious trade, criminals should not hope to hide behind these provisions of our constitution. "
"8861",1996,"Mandela","The government will use all lawful means to ensure that they do not succeed in undermining our social fabric.  "
"8862",1996,"Mandela","Law-abiding citizens can rest assured that there are effective mechanisms in place to prevent and punish any rapacious invasion of their lives. "
"8863",1996,"Mandela","Our security services are committed to follow the rules, because they know, as much as we all do, that anything else is a sure recipe for the decay of our democratic system, for a psychosis of fear and a slide into authoritarianism. "
"8864",1996,"Mandela","The government, including the security services, will not allow this to happen.  "
"8865",1996,"Mandela","Tribute also goes to the South African National Defence Force which has distinguished itself in the integration process, in further enhancing its legitimacy in the eyes of our people and the international community, and in assisting the police services to deal with crime and violence.  "
"8866",1996,"Mandela","As should be expected, the new political milieu has dictated that we scale down the resources allocated to the Defence Force. "
"8867",1996,"Mandela","This is a difficult and painful process, particularly for the citizens in uniform. "
"8868",1996,"Mandela","But we wish to assure them, that the aim has never been, and will never be, to undermine this important national resource.  "
"8869",1996,"Mandela","There is national consensus that our Defence Force requires an appropriate capacity and modern equipment. "
"8870",1996,"Mandela","We welcome the fact that debate on these issues is now finding rational reflection in the discussions around the Defence White Paper and the National Defence Review. "
"8871",1996,"Mandela","These processes should be completed during the course of this year, so that we can achieve certainty and a national policy to which all of us can pay allegiance.  "
"8872",1996,"Mandela","Madam Speaker;  If during the course of the past year, South Africa afforded its citizens unprecedented freedom and a human rights culture, the frontiers are bound to widen immeasurably in 1996. "
"8873",1996,"Mandela","The New Patriotism abroad in our nation, is a reflection of how liberating democracy is, for all our citizens in their rainbow colours.  "
"8874",1996,"Mandela","No longer is the state a mighty colossus intimidating everyone in its wake. "
"8875",1996,"Mandela","The openness in this and other legislatures, the transparency of the executive and the participatory style of government - all these have given practical meaning to the concept of government by the people, for the people.  "
"8876",1996,"Mandela","In addition to the independent institutions such as the Constitutional Court, which I mentioned earlier, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will help cement democracy by laying bare that which our nation should never again experience. "
"8877",1996,"Mandela","It will entrench justice by affording victims the reparations due to them. "
"8878",1996,"Mandela","It will, through this, and by means of amnesty, ensure lasting reconciliation.  "
"8879",1996,"Mandela","As with other such institutions, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will succeed only if it gets the co-operation of all of us. "
"8880",1996,"Mandela","I call on all South Africans to respect the Commission's independence and impartiality, its integrity and good faith. "
"8881",1996,"Mandela","The Commissioners themselves have reiterated what the founding legislation pronounces, that the aim of their work is justice and reconciliation, not vengeance.  "
"8882",1996,"Mandela","The frontiers of our freedoms are bound to widen this year, principally because the permanent basic law of the land will be adopted by the Constitutional Assembly. "
"8883",1996,"Mandela","A few months remain before the deadline set in the interim constitution expires. "
"8884",1996,"Mandela","We should burn the midnight oil to meet this deadline; and achieve normal democratic principles accepted everywhere in the world. "
"8885",1996,"Mandela","It is also crucial that we attain constitutional certainty, both for ourselves and in our relations with the international community.  "
"8886",1996,"Mandela","Many difficult issues need to be resolved. "
"8887",1996,"Mandela","Questions of democratic majority rule, co-operative governance, universally- accepted human rights and language equity are only some of them.  "
"8888",1996,"Mandela","As in the past, these matters can only be resolved in genuine negotiations, in the spirit of give and take. "
"8889",1996,"Mandela","The new constitution must be inclusive: a basic law of the land to which all sectors of society can pay allegiance. "
"8890",1996,"Mandela","It behoves all members and parties in the Constitutional Assembly, to take full part in the work of the Assembly, and fulfil the mandate of their supporters. "
"8891",1996,"Mandela","And, in all instances, we should be guided by the imperative to make our country a truly non-racial and non-sexist democracy, its citizens united by equity in their diversity.  "
"8892",1996,"Mandela","These are the principles which should also guide us in protecting and advancing members of our society who have suffered undue privations under apartheid, women and youth, in particular. "
"8893",1996,"Mandela","Honourable members will agree with me, that we cannot allow parliament to rise at the end of this session, before legislation on the Youth and Gender Equality Commissions is adopted. "
"8894",1996,"Mandela","In needs of these sectors, these Commissions will help mobilise the resources required to implement relevant programmes.  children, senior citizens and the disabled. "
"8895",1996,"Mandela","Besides the other programmes indicated earlier, progress is being made in the Cabinet Committee which is developing a National Programme of Action on Children. "
"8896",1996,"Mandela","And the restructuring of the welfare system in general, and as it pertains to the elderly, are among the tasks that the relevant departments are expected to accomplish this year. "
"8897",1996,"Mandela","We wish to reaffirm this government's commitment to introduce programmes that will ensure that the disabled can realise their full potential.  "
"8898",1996,"Mandela","As we deepen our democracy and make progress in our trans- formation, it is to be expected that South Africa will be called upon to relate to the international community more as an equal partner rather than a mere beneficiary of solidarity. "
"8899",1996,"Mandela","This we should be proud of, because it reflects the confidence the world has, in the progress we are making towards creating a normal society.  "
"8900",1996,"Mandela","In addition to hosting important events of the Southern African region, world conferences on critical socio-economic questions, science and technology as well as sporting tournaments, we have started to play an important role in contributing to peace and other efforts of the international community. "
"8901",1996,"Mandela","This we shall always do, within the limits of our capacity.  "
"8902",1996,"Mandela","Our participation at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the United Nations, helped reinforce the voice for the UN to restructure itself in line with the demands of the current age. "
"8903",1996,"Mandela","We are proud that South Africa will this year host the 9th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Conference on the Information Society.  "
"8904",1996,"Mandela","We should not tire of contributing our fair share to the building of a better world, if only because such an outcome is in the best interests of South Africa as well. "
"8905",1996,"Mandela","However, we should always be mindful of the limitations we have as a nation, as well as the constraints of the real world we have to deal with.  "
"8906",1996,"Mandela","We are confident that during the course of this year, progress will be made in the negotiations with members of the Southern African Customs Union, the European Community and other regions, for agreements that will benefit ourselves and our partners. "
"8907",1996,"Mandela","Let us also take this opportunity to reiterate our firm commitment to regional co-operation under the auspices of SADC.  "
"8908",1996,"Mandela","In our relations with virtually all countries of the world, be it in the Organisation of African Unity and its member states, the Bi-national Commissions with the United States and Russia, relations with countries of the Indian Ocean Rim, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and the Americas, we have not only come across goodwill, but also immense opportunities for our country.  "
"8909",1996,"Mandela","As to whether we take full advantage of these opportunities, depends on all of us, both in the public and private sectors. "
"8910",1996,"Mandela","We hope that the Discussion Documents being finalised by the Foreign Ministry will generate informed public debate about our international relations, the better to unite all sectors of our population in advancing the nation's interests.  "
"8911",1996,"Mandela","Madame Speaker;  There is a New Patriotism abroad in our land. "
"8912",1996,"Mandela","Whatever the social stations they occupy, no matter how humble - South Africans are showing a determination to work together and make our country a winning nation. "
"8913",1996,"Mandela","Our task is to harness these energies into a material force for growth and development, safety and security, nation-building and reconciliation.  "
"8914",1996,"Mandela","Such are the demands of this historical moment. "
"8915",1996,"Mandela","Such are the demands of the new South Africa.  "
"8916",1996,"Mandela","I am confident that this Session of parliament will measure up to the challenge of the times.  "
"8917",1996,"Mandela","I thank you."
"8918",1995,"Mandela"," Honourable President and Deputy President of the Senate, Honourable Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly, Deputy Presidents, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Provincial Premiers, Chief Justice, President of the Constitutional Court, Leaders of the National Defence Force, the Police Service and the Correctional Service, Directors General and leaders of the public service, Honourable Members of Parliament, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen:  We have gathered in this hallowed chamber to begin the work of the second session of our democratic parliament, nine months after its first members were sworn in.  "
"8919",1995,"Mandela","Let met say this from the beginning that the challenges ahead of us require that we move away from spectacle and rhetoric and bend our backs to the serious work ahead of us.  "
"8920",1995,"Mandela","I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere appreciation to the leaders of all the parties represented in parliament, the members of parliament, the presiding officers, the whips, the chairpersons of committees, the Secretary of Parliament and his staff for the sterling work that was done from the day that this first democratic and non-racial parliament convened.  "
"8921",1995,"Mandela","Of necessity, much of this work had to do with the establishment of our organisations structures and evolving a rhythm of work which would enable us to discharge our responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner.  "
"8922",1995,"Mandela","All of us, precisely because we had never sat in any democratic parliament before, had to begin the continuing process of learning how to carry out our functions as people's deputies.  "
"8923",1995,"Mandela","We had to educate ourselves in an atmosphere characterised by a critical public focus which did not necessarily allow for the reality of that inexperience.  "
"8924",1995,"Mandela","Undoubtedly, many of us, both in the legislature and in the executive have made mistakes. "
"8925",1995,"Mandela","But mistakes are an inevitable element of any process of learning.  "
"8926",1995,"Mandela","It is always the case that the spectators are better than the players on the field. "
"8927",1995,"Mandela","None of us should therefore feel ashamed for having committed errors. "
"8928",1995,"Mandela","We must, however, learn from these mistakes so that we do indeed improve our performance.  "
"8929",1995,"Mandela","Whatever it is that our critics might have to say, we can take pride in the fact that not only did we succeed to establish our two houses of parliament, as required by the Constitution, but we also ensured that they play their role in the government of our country.  "
"8930",1995,"Mandela","We are pleased that the honourable members of both the National Assembly and the Senate have not been satisfied merely to endorse the bills that have been presented to them, but have participated actively in improving such draft legislation, with the aim of ensuring that our laws are consistent with the glorious vision we share of creating a truly humane and people-centred society.  "
"8931",1995,"Mandela","Of particular importance is the fact that you, the legislators, have worked in a manner consistent with the objective of ensuring that ours should be a parliament of the people.  "
"8932",1995,"Mandela","This we have done by opening our proceedings to the public, to ensure that the people know what we are doing and by opening the doors to the people to address the legislative committees of parliament directly.  "
"8933",1995,"Mandela","This has also been replicated in our provincial legislatures, consistent with our objective of bringing government as close to the people as possible.  "
"8934",1995,"Mandela","We can therefore claim with justification that such legislating as has been approved is representative of the will of the people and therefore enjoys a degree of legitimacy and enforceability which all previous laws could never have.  "
"8935",1995,"Mandela","Undoubtedly, we must continue to look for ways and means of ensuring that the people as a whole are better informed of what we are doing and are given ever improved capacity to intervene in our proceedings in an informed and purposive manner.  "
"8936",1995,"Mandela","In the recent past, much has been said about corruption among some members of this parliament and other leading political figures in the country.  "
"8937",1995,"Mandela","Many within and without this chamber and among the mass media have been very keen to condemn and to propel us into precipitate action on the basis of mere allegations.  "
"8938",1995,"Mandela","We have resisted this and will continue to do so. "
"8939",1995,"Mandela","We have a responsibility to act on the basis of fact and not allegations, however strident the voice that makes those allegations.  "
"8940",1995,"Mandela","Furthermore, we firmly believe that it is important that we build a society on justice and fairness. "
"8941",1995,"Mandela","At all times we must guarantee the right of the accused to be heard, without making any concession to a primeval instinct to pillory and burn people at the stake.  "
"8942",1995,"Mandela","As South Africans, with our particular history, we must be extremely careful not to reintroduce the McCarthyism atmosphere which resulted in people being herded into unthinking hordes that sought the blood of anybody who was labelled a communist.  "
"8943",1995,"Mandela","We must also make this clear that we need no educators with regard to the matter of rooting out corruption, which we will deal with firmly and unequivocally, whoever may be involved.  "
"8944",1995,"Mandela","We are conscious of the reality that corruption in many forms has deeply infected the fibre of our society. "
"8945",1995,"Mandela","It is not possible to have a society based on a lie and patent injustice as apartheid society was, without this spawning corrupt practices.  "
"8946",1995,"Mandela","Precisely because we face the challenge of dealing with systematic corruption we need a dispassionate and systematic approach to this question and not allow ourselves to be stampeded by responses which are not very different from a witchhunt.  "
"8947",1995,"Mandela","To address another important matter of the day, later this year we will be holding our local government elections to complete the process of establishing the democratic structures which we need to ensure that the people are able to take their destiny into their own hands.  "
"8948",1995,"Mandela","The importance of these popularly elected structures at the local level cannot be overestimated. "
"8949",1995,"Mandela","It is at this level that we must deliver change. "
"8950",1995,"Mandela","It is at this level that the people can most directly participate in making decisions about important matters that affect their daily lives.  "
"8951",1995,"Mandela","It is also at this level that we must confront the divisions created by the system of apartheid and grapple with the problems that arise out of the racial and territorial maldistribution of resources and infrastructure that was imposed on the country by this system.  "
"8952",1995,"Mandela","In reality, it is impossible to enter this next and critical stage of the dismantling of the system of apartheid until we have democratically elected structures of government which enjoy a popular mandate to bring about the non-racial, non-sexist and democratic society demanded of us by the constitution.  "
"8953",1995,"Mandela","I would therefore like to take this opportunity to call on all our people in their millions to take the forthcoming local government elections very seriously.  "
"8954",1995,"Mandela","The immediate task that we must all fulfil is to register as voters. "
"8955",1995,"Mandela","I appeal to all political parties, both those represented in our national and provincial legislatures and those outside of these structures, to do everything in their power to mobilise the people to register as voters.  "
"8956",1995,"Mandela","This appeal also extends to all other people's organisations and institutions of civil society to use their influence or organise the people to register for an participate in the local government elections.  "
"8957",1995,"Mandela","It is also the obligation of all political organisations that will participate in the local government elections to ensure that we experience no violence or intimidation during the conduct of our election campaigns.  "
"8958",1995,"Mandela","It would also like to take advantage of this occasion to make it very clear to the country as a whole that the Government will not allow anybody to obstruct the process of the registration of voters, regardless of the social status of the persons concerned.  "
"8959",1995,"Mandela","It is important to bear in mind that unlike our elections of last year, these elections will be conducted with democratically elected national and provincial government in place. "
"8960",1995,"Mandela","These governments will not hesitate to use all legitimate force at their disposal to ensure that nobody stands in the way of the people to express their will freely.  "
"8961",1995,"Mandela","I am also pleased to report that whatever the teething problems, the concept and vision of a government of national unity has proved its correctness and viability. "
"8962",1995,"Mandela","It has succeeded in its intentions of ensuring co-operation among our people as a whole, the development of a national consensus around a whole range of important matters, enabling important minority parties to have a real voice in the government of the country and contributing to peace, stability and confidence in the future of our country.  "
"8963",1995,"Mandela","At the national level, we continue to work together in a non-confrontational atmosphere further to elaborate rules, conventions and procedures to ensure that the Government of National Unity functions effectively and is able to address in a balanced way the fact of different parties with different policies and the tension between the democratic rights of the majority party and the effective participation of the minority parties.  "
"8964",1995,"Mandela","In this regard I should mention that we have agreed with the Provincial Premiers that we will share our views on these matters with them and their administrations, to evolve common practices conducive to good governance.  "
"8965",1995,"Mandela","Happily, all the major parties have committed themselves to the perspectives contained in the commonly-evolved Reconstruction and Development Programme. "
"8966",1995,"Mandela","This constitutes the firm basis for the continuing co-operation among the various parties inside and outside the Government of National Unity, without which such co-operation would become impossible.  "
"8967",1995,"Mandela","We must however also make this point that when all is said and done, as individuals and as parties we belong to the same government. "
"8968",1995,"Mandela","We therefore have a collective responsibility both to participate in the formulation of policy and the elaboration of decisions and to defend, take responsibility for and implement those decisions.  "
"8969",1995,"Mandela","In the period ahead of us we shall therefore insist on the collective responsibility and accountability of everybody concerned as part of a process in which we must all engage, of raising the levels of discipline and responsible action throughout the society.  "
"8970",1995,"Mandela","A few days ago, we were honoured to participate in the moving and historic opening of our Constitutional Court. "
"8971",1995,"Mandela","This is yet another giant step in the transformation of our judicial system and the building of a law-governed society which will protect the fundamental human rights of all our citizens and ensure that the people are not threatened by arbitrary and oppressive rule.  "
"8972",1995,"Mandela","The process of the transformation of the judiciary will continue, among other things to ensure that it is representative of our society and to enable even the poor to have the ability to obtain legal redress where need arises.  "
"8973",1995,"Mandela","All necessary steps will also be taken to ensure that the judicial system plays its proper role with regard to the important matter of reducing the levels of crime in our society and addressing the legitimate concern of the public that we do not create the situation in which the people begin to feel that criminals and wrong-doers are being favoured while the interests of society are being ignored.  "
"8974",1995,"Mandela","Further progress will also be made this year to establish other institutions that are critical to the construction of the people-centred society to which we are all committed  Among these will be the Human Rights Commission, the Public Protector, the Gender and Youth Commissions, the Inspector General of Intelligence and the structures that will be created by the pending Open Democracy or Freedom of Information Act.  "
"8975",1995,"Mandela","We are determined to move with all due speed to create and strengthen all the institutions of governance that we have spoken of to deal with the matter of effective and open government.  "
"8976",1995,"Mandela","Once more, we must address a few words to our public service, without whose dedicated service to the people effective government and public delivery to the population will be impossible.  "
"8977",1995,"Mandela","We are committed to the motivation of all public sector workers so that they become a conscious, willing and skilled agent for the transformation of our society according to the objectives spelt out in the Reconstruction and Development Programme.  "
"8978",1995,"Mandela","As part of this process, Cabinet has given instructions to all Ministers to interact continuously with all members of their ministries and departments to brief them about their tasks, to report on progress achieved, to agree on how to overcome obstacles to the process of transformation and generally to be involved in the struggle for change.  "
"8979",1995,"Mandela","We have also invited the public sector unions to participate as fully as possible in the budgeting processes so that they make their own contribution to the difficult task of deciding the best possible allocation of the limited resources available to government.  "
"8980",1995,"Mandela","We are convinced that an adversarial relationship between the executive and the administration would impact negatively on the common task which these two institutions share of serving the people of South Africa. "
"8981",1995,"Mandela","Such an outcome must be avoided at all costs.  "
"8982",1995,"Mandela","Accordingly, we have been available and willing to address all matters of concern to the public service workers, including questions of salaries, promotions, pensions and other issues relevant to working conditions.  "
"8983",1995,"Mandela","It is however also important that the public service should be willing to join hands with the government to address other important matters such as the racial and gender imbalances within the public service.  "
"8984",1995,"Mandela","The public service will never be fully acceptable to the people as a whole and can never be truly responsive to the needs of the people unless it is composed in all its ranks in a manner that reflects the composition of our population.  "
"8985",1995,"Mandela","To speed up this process, the government will continue to implement measures and programmes aiming at ensuring that those who were disadvantaged by apartheid in the past are given the capacity to catch up with those who were given the possibility to develop and advance themselves in terms of management and other skills.  "
"8986",1995,"Mandela","This is what we mean when we talk of affirmative action programmes. "
"8987",1995,"Mandela","We speak of a human resource development programme which will ensure that all our people, and not merely some, are given the possibility to develop their talents and to contribute to the reconstruction and development of society to the best of their ability.  "
"8988",1995,"Mandela","I therefore call on all our people to refuse to listen to the false prophets who seek to perpetuate the apartheid divisions and imbalances of the past by presenting affirmative action as a programme intended to advantage some and disadvantage others on the basis of race and colour.  "
"8989",1995,"Mandela","It is also appropriate that on this occasion we draw the attention of the country to the actual reality that the government has extremely limited resources to address the many and urgent needs of our people.  "
"8990",1995,"Mandela","We are very keen that this real situation should be communicated to the people as a whole. "
"8991",1995,"Mandela","All of us, especially the leadership of political organisations and civil society, must rid ourselves of the wrong notion that the government has a big bag full of money. "
"8992",1995,"Mandela","The government does not have such riches.  "
"8993",1995,"Mandela","Because we have started the process of changing spending priorities, we do realise that the process of restructuring the budget so that it is directed towards addressing the needs of the people is no easy matter. "
"8994",1995,"Mandela","This is especially so in the light of the contractual obligations that bind the state as well as carry over expenditure which cannot be avoided.  "
"8995",1995,"Mandela","We must all absorb this reality into our thinking in a cold and dispassionate manner and not allow ourselves to be seduced into a world of false hopes leading to unrealistic actions based on the wrong assumption that the government can be coerced to meet demands that it cannot meet, however justified and legitimate these demands might be.  "
"8996",1995,"Mandela","It is important that we rid ourselves of the culture of entitlement which leads to the expectation that the government must promptly deliver whatever it is that we demand, and result in some people refusing to meet their obligations such as rent and service payments or engaging in other unacceptable actions such as the forcible occupation of houses.  "
"8997",1995,"Mandela","As we have said with regard to the public sector unions, we seek to ensure that the budgeting process is as transparent and as participatory as possible.  "
"8998",1995,"Mandela","It is the right of the people to know how much money they have contributed to the finances of the state and how that money is being used. "
"8999",1995,"Mandela","It is their right also not only to know, but also to contribute their views as to how public funds should be disbursed.  "
"9000",1995,"Mandela","That is why such bodies as the parliamentary committees and the National Economic Forum have been brought into the budgeting process.  "
"9001",1995,"Mandela","Tomorrow we shall be launching a very important body, the National Economic Development and Labour Council -NEDLAC. "
"9002",1995,"Mandela","This crucial body will bring together representatives of government, labour, capital and civil society.  "
"9003",1995,"Mandela","This will be one of the institutions on which we will relay in terms of decisions that we must arrive at with regard to the use of public funds and assets. "
"9004",1995,"Mandela","We trust that the representatives that sit of NEDLAC will, in turn, reach out to their own constituencies to inform and involve them in the process of arriving at decisions which bear, among other things, on the disbursement of public funds.  "
"9005",1995,"Mandela","What we have said constitutes a firm undertaking on the part of government to ensure a participatory process with regard to the public finances.  "
"9006",1995,"Mandela","Bearing this in mind, we believe that government has a right to expect that the public at large should behave in a responsible manner when it addresses the question of the obligations of government to meet the material expectations of the people.  "
"9007",1995,"Mandela","I would like to address this matter bluntly.  "
"9008",1995,"Mandela","The strike action which has been threatened by a few of the public sector unions will not succeed to force the government to make available money for large wage and salary increases.  "
"9009",1995,"Mandela","I say this being fully aware and sympathetic to the plight of many public sector workers who are indeed poorly paid.  "
"9010",1995,"Mandela","I say it precisely because I am aware of the reality that, for no fault of its own, the government literally does not have the money to meet the demands that are being advanced. "
"9011",1995,"Mandela","Mass action of any kind will not create resources that the government does not have and would only serve to subvert the capacity of government to serve the people.  "
"9012",1995,"Mandela","I would like to repeat that the government is committed to entering into a comprehensive three-year agreement with the public sector unions to address all matters of mutual interest, including improved packets particularly for the lowest-paid public sector workers.  "
"9013",1995,"Mandela","In this regard, I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to the leaders and the majority of the public sector unions which have engaged with us in a constructive manner which is sensitive to the needs of the country as a whole.  "
"9014",1995,"Mandela","We are ready to work together with these unions to solve the problems which face us together, for the benefit of the workers and society as a whole.  "
"9015",1995,"Mandela","I must also address the question of the attempt by some in our country to introduce anarchy into our society.  "
"9016",1995,"Mandela","I speak of those who engage in such totally unacceptable practices as the murder of police officers, the taking of hostages, riots, looting, the forcible occupation of public buildings, blocking of public highways, vandalisation of public and private property and so on.  "
"9017",1995,"Mandela","Some of those who have initiated and participated in such activities have misread freedom to mean license. "
"9018",1995,"Mandela","They have misinterpreted popular participation to mean their ability to impose chaos on society. "
"9019",1995,"Mandela","They have wrongly concluded that an elected government of the people is a government that is open to compulsion through acts of anarchy.  "
"9020",1995,"Mandela","Let me therefore make this abundantly clear that the small minority in our midst which wears the mask of anarchy will meet its match in the government we lead and the masses of the people who put that government into office.  "
"9021",1995,"Mandela","This they must know that we are not afraid of struggle. "
"9022",1995,"Mandela","We are, after all, a product of confrontation and struggle. "
"9023",1995,"Mandela","In the past we were not defeated by forces more powerful than they. "
"9024",1995,"Mandela","In this instance, we will not be defeated by those whose actions have nothing to do with defending or advancing the cause of the people.  "
"9025",1995,"Mandela","We are certain that the democratic trade unions movement will also join hands with us to isolate and defeat the minority which seeks to discredit the trade union movement by engaging in violent activities during the course of strike actions.  "
"9026",1995,"Mandela","Let is therefore be clear to all that the battle against the forces of anarchy and chaos has been joined. "
"9027",1995,"Mandela","Let no one say they have not been warned.  "
"9028",1995,"Mandela","In the same vein we must address the question of crime. "
"9029",1995,"Mandela","The situation cannot be tolerated in which our country continues to be engulfed by the crime wave which includes murder, crimes against women and children, drug trafficking, armed robbery, fraud and theft.  "
"9030",1995,"Mandela","We must take the war to the criminals and no longer allow the situation in which we are mere sitting ducks of those in our society who, for whatever reason, are bent to engage in criminal and anti-social activities.  "
"9031",1995,"Mandela","Instruction have therefore already gone out to the Minister of Safety and Security, the National Commissioner of the Police Service and the security organs as a whole to take all necessary measures to bring down the levels of crime.  "
"9032",1995,"Mandela","I would also like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the matter of our safety and security is not one that should be left only to the law enforcement organs.  "
"9033",1995,"Mandela","For them to succeed, they need the full and active support of all our communities. "
"9034",1995,"Mandela","The police-community fora that have been established are extremely important with regard to reinforcing co-operation between the police and the public and therefore increasing the capacity of the country as a whole to deal with the common problem of crime.  "
"9035",1995,"Mandela","I would therefore like to urge the formation of such fora where they do not exist and the involvement of all opinion makers in all localities in the processes which are aimed at enhancing the people's safety and security.  "
"9036",1995,"Mandela","The Government is determined to do everything in its power to move speedily towards the formation of the new Police Service. "
"9037",1995,"Mandela","We are very interested to address the matter of the earnings and working conditions of all members of the Police Service and to give this Service the necessary means to enable it do discharge its responsibilities as effectively as possible.  "
"9038",1995,"Mandela","In this regard, we must also make it clear that the Government is opposed to and has no intention to conduct a witchhunt against the police as a result of activities arising from orders given to o the police by the apartheid regime.  "
"9039",1995,"Mandela","We therefore urge every member of the Police Service to get down to the urgent and pressing matter of enhancing the safety and security of the people as a whole.  "
"9040",1995,"Mandela","When we opened parliament last year, we addressed the issue of racism in the workplace and in our society at large.  "
"9041",1995,"Mandela","We continue to be confronted by this problem. "
"9042",1995,"Mandela","People have continued to die as a result of the continuing practice of racism - the latest being a victim of racist resistance to the use of a former white school by lack children.  "
"9043",1995,"Mandela","Those who are responsible for these crimes of racism must be brought to book without delay.  "
"9044",1995,"Mandela","It is clear that insufficient progress has been made in many workplaces and elsewhere in our society to deal with this cancer.  "
"9045",1995,"Mandela","We trust that the Human Rights Commission will help us to deal with this matter firmly and continuously by encouraging the public to report all instances of racism so that these can be brought to light.  "
"9046",1995,"Mandela","The Government has discussed this matter and is committed to carry out its constitutional obligation of transforming our country into a non-racial society. "
"9047",1995,"Mandela","The situation cannot be allowed in which anyone acts in a manner which perpetuates the practice of apartheid.  "
"9048",1995,"Mandela","Both the government and the people as a whole share a common obligation to live up to the very purpose of the struggle that millions of people waged, of ending racism in our country and ensuring the equality of all our people.  "
"9049",1995,"Mandela","One of the most sensitive matters we must address this year is the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. "
"9050",1995,"Mandela","We must move towards this as speedily as possible so as to remove all the uncertainties that have been created through the protracted discussion of this issue.  "
"9051",1995,"Mandela","The legislature is currently discussing the bill dealing with this matter and is receiving public submissions. "
"9052",1995,"Mandela","I would like to urge that we achieve speedy progress in this regard.  "
"9053",1995,"Mandela","I would also like to draw the attention of the legislature and the country as a whole, that our purpose in establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is both to obtain the truth and to reinforce the process of reconciliation which our country needs.  "
"9054",1995,"Mandela","Nothing we do should lead to the heightening of tensions and the rekindling of the violent political conflicts which we have succeeded so well to bring under reasonable control.  "
"9055",1995,"Mandela","This must also be borne in mind that many of us, who suffered quite significantly as a result of apartheid repression, are making no demands which would result in vengeance against or persecution of those who might have harmed us or those close to us.  "
"9056",1995,"Mandela","Urgent steps are also required to end the continuing political violence in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. "
"9057",1995,"Mandela","This is both a law-enforcement issue and a matter for the political parties and leaders in the province to address.  "
"9058",1995,"Mandela","If we claim to be genuine leaders of our people, it must surely be one of our principle tasks to end the killing both to save lives and to create the climate of peace and stability which we need to develop the province which is among the poorest areas in the country.  "
"9059",1995,"Mandela","Progress has been made with regard to the basic challenge of building a better life for all our people.  "
"9060",1995,"Mandela","Some of the projects which we announced last year, including the feeding of school children and the provision of free health services to certain sections of our population, have been implemented.  "
"9061",1995,"Mandela","It is necessary that we draw the necessary lessons from our experience in this effort to meet the basic needs of the people.  "
"9062",1995,"Mandela","One of these, as we have stated already, is that the Government has very limited resources to address the multiple and urgent needs of our people.  "
"9063",1995,"Mandela","It is therefore critical that we determine a proper set of priorities on which we should focus to effect a visible and sustainable improvement in the lives of the people. "
"9064",1995,"Mandela","It is also important that we implement any projects in this regard not in an ad-hoc manner, but within the context of 5-year and other medium and long-term plans and projections.  "
"9065",1995,"Mandela","The Cabinet has discussed this matter and decided on our priorities, which will include rural and urban development, human resource development, job creation and health.  "
"9066",1995,"Mandela","Detailed inter-departmental work is now going on to elaborate plans reflecting this focus, to ensure that the Government uses in a rational and effective manner the limited resources at its disposal. "
"9067",1995,"Mandela","In this regard, government will not make any commitments which it cannot meet on a continuous basis.  "
"9068",1995,"Mandela","As compared to the time last year when we had to announce programmes for transformation without detailed preparation of implementable and affordable plans, we are now in the fortunate situation that we are well on the way to finalising detailed plans, to meet our firm commitment to build a better life for all South Africans.  "
"9069",1995,"Mandela","Once they are ready, and after the necessary consultation with the elected representatives at both national and provincial levels, the local community structures and the public at large, we are determined, this year, to move speedily to expedite the process of social transformation and the improvement of the quality of life of our people, which is required of us in the context of our programme for reconstruction and development.  "
"9070",1995,"Mandela","This will be one of the high points in our national life, this year, when we announce realistic targets with regard to such needs as houses, clean water, primary health care and jobs.  "
"9071",1995,"Mandela","I must repeat that it is our firm intention that we set these targets within the parameters of what the budget can carry, consistent with our objective of ensuring fiscal discipline.  "
"9072",1995,"Mandela","We will be able to achieve this degree of precision because of the significant progress that has been made in the various ministries at both national and provincial levels with regard both to the reorganisation and strengthening these structures and the elaboration of policies aimed at the fundamental transformation of our country.  "
"9073",1995,"Mandela","For this, we should salute the Ministers, the Premiers, the Directors General and other members of the public service for the work they have done to increase the capacity of government to engage in the process of transformation.  "
"9074",1995,"Mandela","With regard to this critical matter of socio-economic transformation, I would, once again, like to draw attention to the important role that NEDLAC will have to play to ensure effective co-ordination and partnership between government, labour, business and community-based organisations.  "
"9075",1995,"Mandela","This body will play a critical role in helping to develop the consensus we need with regard to the critical challenges of reconstruction and development, including economic growth, socio-economic improvement and the involvement of all stakeholders in all decision-making processes.  "
"9076",1995,"Mandela","In a sense, NEDLAC and other fora where consensus is being achieved across the social spectrum, are crucial power houses of our nation-building and reconstruction efforts. "
"9077",1995,"Mandela","They are the engine which cannot be derailed by the whims of individuals or political parties.  "
"9078",1995,"Mandela","As the year begins, there are signs that our economy is beginning to pick up. "
"9079",1995,"Mandela","The Government sondiers it a matter of critical importance that everything should be done to encourage a climate conducive to sustained and high levels of economic growth.  "
"9080",1995,"Mandela","We are therefore ready to deal and have been dealing with all matters that are relevant to this goal, in particular to ensure the creation of an investor-friendly climate.  "
"9081",1995,"Mandela","Everything must be done to encourage a significant upward movement in the rate of investment to increase the productive capacity of the economy, to modernise and restructure the economy, to create jobs and to increase our international competitiveness.  "
"9082",1995,"Mandela","With regard to these economic issues, I would also like to emphasise our continuing commitments to fiscal discipline, including the reduction of the budget deficit, the reduction of the share of the national income that accrues to government and the reorientation of government expenditure away from recurrent disbursements towards investment.  "
"9083",1995,"Mandela","The relevant authorities, including the Reserve bank, remain seized of the issue of the two-tier exchange rate and the general question of foreign exchange controls. "
"9084",1995,"Mandela","These matters will be addressed with the necessary speed and the equally necessary sense of responsibility towards the economy as a whole.  "
"9085",1995,"Mandela","At the same time, the Government is working as expeditiously as possible to address the question of the reorganisation of state assets.  "
"9086",1995,"Mandela","With regard to these assets, our objective is to ensure that they are used in a conscious and consistent manner to address the objectives of the RDP, One of these must surely be to reduce the public debt and therefore the burden of servicing this debt, so that more public funds can be released to address the needs of the people.  "
"9087",1995,"Mandela","This year parliament will be faced with a heavy load of extremely important legislation that it will have to deal with. "
"9088",1995,"Mandela","The importance of this legislation derives from the fact that it will be transformative in character, aimed at the creation of the social order which for which many struggled and sacrificed.  "
"9089",1995,"Mandela","One of these pieces of legislation is the Labour Relations Bill which represents not only a decisive shift from our adversarial past in labour relations, but also our commitment to a more democratic style of governance.  "
"9090",1995,"Mandela","While correctly entrenching the right of workers to resort to strike action, the Bill places emphasis on conciliation and negotiation of disputes and should contribute significantly to reducing the level of unnecessary industrial action and creating greater possibilities for joint action between government, labour and business to build a prosperous and just society.  "
"9091",1995,"Mandela","Similarly, white papers and legislation will be introduced covering such areas as education, health, housing, water affairs, safety and security, defence, truth and reconciliation, freedom of information, land affairs, the public service, welfare and so on, to say nothing of the 1995-96 budget.  "
"9092",1995,"Mandela","This will undoubtedly tax the energies of the members and resources of parliament. "
"9093",1995,"Mandela","However, we will have to ensure that we deal with all this legislation as expeditiously as possible, while consulting the people also as extensively as possible.  "
"9094",1995,"Mandela","We should therefore have an exciting session which should inspire all or people as they see their elected representatives create the legislative framework which will mark our continued movement away from the past towards the people-centred society we seek to construct.  "
"9095",1995,"Mandela","We will also have to ensure that the Constitutional Assembly makes progress towards the drafting to the new Constitution. "
"9096",1995,"Mandela","It is important that this should be done so that we can have certainty as soon as possible about the constitutional framework within which the country should be governed.  "
"9097",1995,"Mandela","It may be worth repeating that we seek a constitution that is acceptable to the people as a whole. "
"9098",1995,"Mandela","It was for this reason that all of those who participated in the drafting of the present constitution agreed to the concept of special majorities and an entrenchment set of principles.  "
"9099",1995,"Mandela","As we negotiate the new constitution, it is necessary to bear these observation in mind and conduct ourselves in a manner that ensures that we have as inclusive a process as possible.  "
"9100",1995,"Mandela","It seems necessary that there should be close co-operation and co-ordination between the legislature and the Constitutional Assembly with regard to the issue of consultation with the public, as both these bodies will be seeking to reach as many people as possible during this year.  "
"9101",1995,"Mandela","We will have to conduct the processes of public consultation in a manner that is both cost effective and enables the people genuinely to contribute both to the legislative and the constitutional debates.  "
"9102",1995,"Mandela","This year, the nations will be observing the related 50th anniversaries of the end of the Second World War and the establishment of the United Nations Organisation.  "
"9103",1995,"Mandela","Coming as we do from our own specific past, it will be important that we join in the observance of these historic events. "
"9104",1995,"Mandela","Thus should we affirm our own commitment to the vision contained in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the UN Charter and other important legal instruments and conventions that the UN has evolved to deal with the issues of racism, war and peace, human rights and development.  "
"9105",1995,"Mandela","Among these conventions, which will be ratified during the course of this parliamentary session, is the very important International Convention on the Rights of the Child.  "
"9106",1995,"Mandela","We might also want to use this occasion to make our contribution to the international debate about the new world order, focusing in particular on such matters as a democratic international political order, universal prosperity, peace and stability - all of which are questions of great relevance to our own continent of Africa.  "
"9107",1995,"Mandela","In this regard, the UN Social Summit next month and the International Women's Conference in Beijing later in the year, will be crucial fora in which we should make our own humble contribution to the effort to create a better world.  "
"9108",1995,"Mandela","In this context, during this year we will pay particular attention to the all-round development and strengthening of our relations with our neighbours in Southern Africa, especially within the context of the SADC.  "
"9109",1995,"Mandela","We are all inspired by the reality of progressive developments in our region during the recent period.  "
"9110",1995,"Mandela","These include the successful democratic elections in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana and our own country, the restoration of democracy in Lesotho and the signing of the Angola Peace Agreement. "
"9111",1995,"Mandela","All this augurs well for the future of all our peoples.  "
"9112",1995,"Mandela","At the same time, we are all aware of the tensions that are building up with regard to population movements within our region. "
"9113",1995,"Mandela","We must treat this matter with all due sensitivity, conscious of the history of our region, including the destruction caused by the policy of aggression and destabilisation carried out by the previous regime.  "
"9114",1995,"Mandela","In all our actions we must move from the position that the fundamental objective we must pursue is friendship, co-operation and solidarity among the peoples of our region.  "
"9115",1995,"Mandela","We rake this opportunity to wish the people of Angola well and once more to convey to them and all their leaders our willingness to contribute whatever we can to assist in the establishment of a permanent peace and the strengthening of the democratic order.  "
"9116",1995,"Mandela","We will continue to make our contribution to the strengthening of the OAU, which remains an important instrument that we all need to address the serious concerns of the peoples of our continent.  "
"9117",1995,"Mandela","We also hope to conclude our negotiations with the European Union as soon as possible to strengthen our economic and other relations with this important group of countries in a manner that does not disadvantage any other country.  "
"9118",1995,"Mandela","In a fortnight will also be established the Joint South Africa - United States Commission which will supervise the important process of strengthening the relations between ourselves and the United States of America.  "
"9119",1995,"Mandela","In a few days the Prime Minister of Sweden will arrive in this city. "
"9120",1995,"Mandela","We welcome this visit by the leader of one of the Scandinavian countries all of which played such an important role in the struggle for the emancipation of all our people.  "
"9121",1995,"Mandela","The visit also emphasises the positive manner in which our relations with the rest of the world are developing. "
"9122",1995,"Mandela","It will be followed by other visits as well our own to other countries, in the interest of our own development and in the interest of a better world for all peoples.  "
"9123",1995,"Mandela","This parliament has, through death, lost some of the best among us. "
"9124",1995,"Mandela","These include Firoza Adam, Thomas Nkobi and Joe Slovo. "
"9125",1995,"Mandela","Let the results of this second session of our democratic parliament serve as our salute to them and a tribute to their memory. "
"9126",1995,"Mandela","I am certain you will not fail them.  "
"9127",1995,"Mandela","I have the honour to declare the second session of our democratic parliament open.  "
"9128",1995,"Mandela","Thank you."
"9129",1994,"Mandela"," Madame Speaker and Deputy Speaker, President of the Senate and Deputy President, Deputy Presidents, Chief Justice, distinguished members of the National Assembly and the Senate, Provincial Premiers, Commanders of the Security Forces, members of the Diplomatic Corps, esteemed guests, comrades, ladies and gentlemen.  "
"9130",1994,"Mandela","The time will come when our nation will honour the memory of all the sons, the daughters, the mothers, the fathers, the youth and the children who, by their thoughts and deeds, gave us the right to assert with pride that we are South Africans, that we are Africans and that we are citizens of the world.  "
"9131",1994,"Mandela","The certainties that come with age tell me that among these we shall find an Afrikaner woman who transcended a particular experience and became a South African, an African and a citizen of the world.  "
"9132",1994,"Mandela","Her name is Ingrid Jonker.  "
"9133",1994,"Mandela","She was both a poet and a South African. "
"9134",1994,"Mandela","She was both an Afrikaner and an African. "
"9135",1994,"Mandela","She was both an artist and a human being.  "
"9136",1994,"Mandela","In the midst of despair, she celebrated hope. "
"9137",1994,"Mandela","Confronted with death, she asserted the beauty of life.  "
"9138",1994,"Mandela","In the dark days when all seemed hopeless in our country, when many refused to hear her resonant voice, she took her own life.  "
"9139",1994,"Mandela","To her and others like her, we owe a debt to life itself. "
"9140",1994,"Mandela","To her and others like her, we owe a commitment to the poor, the oppressed, the wretched and the despised.  "
"9141",1994,"Mandela","In the aftermath of the massacre at the anti-pass demonstration in Sharpeville she wrote that:  ""The child is not dead the child lifts his fists against his mother who shouts Africa!...  "
"9142",1994,"Mandela","The child is not dead Not at Langa nor at Nyanga nor at Orlando nor at Sharpeville nor at the police post at Philippi where he lies with a bullet through his brain...  the child is present at all assemblies and law-giving the child peers through the windows of houses and into the hearts of mothers this child who only wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere  the child grown to a man treks on through all Africa the child grown to a giant journeys over the whole world without a pass!""  "
"9143",1994,"Mandela","And in this glorious vision, she instructs that our endeavours must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child.  "
"9144",1994,"Mandela","It is these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of the seat of government.  "
"9145",1994,"Mandela","And so we must, constrained by and yet regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical burdens, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want to make of our shared destiny.  "
"9146",1994,"Mandela","The government I have the honour to lead and I dare say the masses who elected us to serve in this role, are inspired by the single vision of creating a people-centred society.  "
"9147",1994,"Mandela","Accordingly, the purpose that will drive this government shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human fulfilment, the continuous extension of the frontiers of the freedom.  "
"9148",1994,"Mandela","The acid test of the legitimacy of the programmes we elaborate, the government institutions we create, the legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these objectives.  "
"9149",1994,"Mandela","Our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual.  "
"9150",1994,"Mandela","We must construct that people-centred society of freedom in such a manner that it guarantees the political and the human rights of all our citizens.  "
"9151",1994,"Mandela","As an affirmation of the government's commitment to an entrenched human rights culture, we shall immediately take steps to inform the Secretary General of the United Nations that we will subscribe to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  "
"9152",1994,"Mandela","We shall take steps to ensure that we accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Social and Economic Rights and other human rights instruments of the United Nations.  "
"9153",1994,"Mandela","Our definition of the freedom of the individual must be instructed by the fundamental objective to restore the human dignity of each and every South African.  "
"9154",1994,"Mandela","This requires that we speak not only of political freedoms.  "
"9155",1994,"Mandela","My government's commitment to create a people-centred society of liberty binds us to the pursuit of the goals of freedom from want, freedom from hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom from suppression and freedom from fear.  "
"9156",1994,"Mandela","These freedoms are fundamental to the guarantee of human dignity. "
"9157",1994,"Mandela","They will therefore constitute part of the centrepiece of what this government will seek to achieve, the focal point on which our attention will be continuously focused.  "
"9158",1994,"Mandela","The things we have said constitute the true meaning, the justification and the purpose of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, without which it would lose all legitimacy.  "
"9159",1994,"Mandela","When we elaborated this Programme we were inspired by the hope that all South Africans of goodwill could join together to provide a better life for all. "
"9160",1994,"Mandela","We were pleased that other political organisations announced similar aims.  "
"9161",1994,"Mandela","Today, I am happy to announce that the Cabinet of the Government of National Unity has reached consensus not only on the broad objective of the creation of the people-centred society of which I have spoken, but also on many elements of a plan broadly based on that Programme for Reconstruction and Development.  "
"9162",1994,"Mandela","Let me indicate some of the more important agreements. "
"9163",1994,"Mandela","Annually, in the combined budgets of central government and the provinces, we will provide for an increasing amount of funding for the plan.  "
"9164",1994,"Mandela","This will start with an appropriation of R2,5 billion in the 1994/95 budget that will be presented next month. "
"9165",1994,"Mandela","This should rise to more than R10 billion by the fifth year of the life of this government.  "
"9166",1994,"Mandela","Government will also use its own allocation of funds to the Reconstruction and Development Plan to exert maximum leverage in marshalling funds from within South Africa and abroad.  "
"9167",1994,"Mandela","In this regard, I am pleased to report that we have been holding consultation with some of the principal business leaders of our country.  "
"9168",1994,"Mandela","Consequently, we are assured that the business sector can and will make a significant contribution towards the structuring and management of such reconstruction and development funds, towards the effective identification and implementation of projects and by supporting the financing of the socio-economic development effort.  "
"9169",1994,"Mandela","I am also pleased to report that many of our friends abroad have already made commitments to assist us to generate the reconstruction and development funds we need.  "
"9170",1994,"Mandela","We thank them most sincerely for their positive attitude which arises not from objectives of charity but from the desire to express solidarity with the new society we seek to build.  "
"9171",1994,"Mandela","We accept the duty of coordinating the management of the total resources that will be generated, without seeking to prescribe to other contributors or undermining the continued role of non-governmental organisations and community-based organisations.  "
"9172",1994,"Mandela","The initial R2,5 billion will be found from savings and the redirection of spending, as included in the preliminary 1994/95 budget proposals presented to Cabinet.  "
"9173",1994,"Mandela","I would like to thank the departments of state for their cooperation in carrying out this adjustment to their planning, at short notice.  "
"9174",1994,"Mandela","As we allocate larger amount in future, we shall require further adjustments by departments, partly to correct the bias in the spending patterns which are a legacy of the past.  "
"9175",1994,"Mandela","The longer period shall allow such changes to be properly planned. "
"9176",1994,"Mandela","But they will still make great demands on the managerial capacity and spirit of cooperation of the Cabinet and the whole civil service.  "
"9177",1994,"Mandela","We are confident that, motivated by the desire to serve the people, the public service will discharge its responsibilities with diligence, sensitivity and enthusiasm, among other things paying attention to the important goal of increasing efficiency and productivity.  "
"9178",1994,"Mandela","My government is equally committed to ensure that we use this longer period properly fully to bring into the decision-making processes organs of civil society.  "
"9179",1994,"Mandela","This will include the trade union movement and civic organisations, so that at no time should the government become isolated from the people. "
"9180",1994,"Mandela","At the same time, steps will be taken to build the capacity of communities to manage their own affairs.  "
"9181",1994,"Mandela","Precisely because we are committed to ensuring sustainable growth and development leading to a better life for all, we will continue existing programmes of fiscal rehabilitation.  "
"9182",1994,"Mandela","We are therefore determined to make every effort to contain real general government consumption at present levels and to manage the budget deficit with a view to its continuous reduction.  "
"9183",1994,"Mandela","Similarly, we are agreed that a permanently higher general level of taxation is to be avoided.  "
"9184",1994,"Mandela","To achieve these important objectives will require consistent discipline on the part of both the central and the provincial governments.  "
"9185",1994,"Mandela","Furthermore, this disciplined approach will ensure that we integrate the objectives of our Reconstruction and Development Plan within government expenditure and not treat them as incidental to the tasks of government, marginalised to the status of mere additions to the level of expenditure.  "
"9186",1994,"Mandela","There are major areas of desperate need in our society.  "
"9187",1994,"Mandela","As a signal of its seriousness to address these, the government will, within the next 100 days, implement various projects under the direct supervision of the President. "
"9188",1994,"Mandela","Let me briefly mention these.  "
"9189",1994,"Mandela","Children under the age of six and pregnant mothers will receive free medical care in every state hospital and clinic where such need exists. "
"9190",1994,"Mandela","Similarly, a nutritional feeding scheme will be implemented in every primary school where such need is established. "
"9191",1994,"Mandela","A concrete process of consultation between the major stakeholders in this area will be organised immediately.  "
"9192",1994,"Mandela","A programme is already being implemented to electrify 350 000 homes during the current financial year.  "
"9193",1994,"Mandela","A campaign will be launched at every level of government, a public works programme designed and all efforts made to involve the private sector, organised labour, the civics and other community organisations to rebuild our townships, restore services in rural and urban areas, while addressing the issue of job creation and training, especially for our unemployed youth.  "
"9194",1994,"Mandela","Many details of the overall reconstruction and development plan remain to be discussed, agreed and put in place. "
"9195",1994,"Mandela","But I believe that the broad outline I have given and the immediate initiatives I have mentioned, will allow you to share my joy at the progress already made by the Government of National Unity with regard to this important matter.  "
"9196",1994,"Mandela","We shall carry out this plan within the context of a policy aimed at building a strong and growing economy which will benefit all our people.  "
"9197",1994,"Mandela","I would like to deal with a few matters in this regard.  "
"9198",1994,"Mandela","In support of sustainable economic growth and the macro-economic objective of Government, it will remain the primary objective of monetary policy to promote and maintain overall financial stability.  "
"9199",1994,"Mandela","The Reserve Bank has the important function of protecting the value of our currency and striving for relative price stability at all times.  "
"9200",1994,"Mandela","We are pleased that Dr Chris Stals will continue to serve as Governor of the Reserve Bank.  "
"9201",1994,"Mandela","The battle to reduce the rate of inflation will continue. "
"9202",1994,"Mandela","The realisation of many of our objectives for a fair and equal treatment of all our people will not be possible unless we succeed in avoiding high inflation in the economy.  "
"9203",1994,"Mandela","We also face a major challenge in re-entering the global economy, while stable prices are vital to the restructuring of our industries and dealing with the critical issue of job-creation.  "
"9204",1994,"Mandela","We are blessed with a heritage of a sophisticated financial sector. "
"9205",1994,"Mandela","Our financial markets are well-placed to play an important part in the allocation of scarce funds to give effect to our economic development programme.  "
"9206",1994,"Mandela","It is however also necessary that we think in new ways, to meet the challenges of reconstruction and development.  "
"9207",1994,"Mandela","We therefore welcome recent developments that provide for the creation of community banks. "
"9208",1994,"Mandela","We would also like to encourage the greater participation of established financial institutions in the important area of black economic empowerment and support for the development of small and medium business.  "
"9209",1994,"Mandela","The latter two areas of economic activity will receive the greatest attention of the Government because of their importance in deracialising and democratising the economy and creating the jobs which our people need.  "
"9210",1994,"Mandela","We pay attention to the important matter of consumer protection to shield the ordinary people of our country from unscrupulous business practices.  "
"9211",1994,"Mandela","We must also clear that we must pay increased attention to tourism. "
"9212",1994,"Mandela","The jobs and foreign currency which tourism generates will strongly influence our economy.  "
"9213",1994,"Mandela","The active and imaginative intervention of all stake stakeholders in this area of our national life must take advantage of the excellent atmosphere created by our peaceful transition to democracy to make tourism a major positive force in the future.  "
"9214",1994,"Mandela","We look forward to the private sector as a whole playing a central role in achieving the signi-ficantly high and sustainable rates of economic growth.  "
"9215",1994,"Mandela","We are convinced that the growth prospects of this sector will be enhanced by the measures of fiscal discipline contained in our approach to the Reconstruction and Development Programme and by the continued steady course of monetary policy.  "
"9216",1994,"Mandela","As growth proceeds, more domestic savings will progressively become available to finance increased investment at reasonable rates of interest.  "
"9217",1994,"Mandela","The Government is also acutely conscious of the fact that we should work firstly to return the capital account of the balance of payments to equilibrium and, in due course, to ensure a net inflow of resources, consistent with the experience of other countries that enjoy more rapid growth rates.  "
"9218",1994,"Mandela","The present situation of a dual currency and the existence of an exchange control apparatus is a direct result of the conflict in which our country was embroiled in the past.  "
"9219",1994,"Mandela","As the situation returns to normal, these arrangements will be subjected to critical scrutiny. "
"9220",1994,"Mandela","It should be possible to match the steady growth of confidence at home and abroad with other confidence enhancing modifications to everybody's benefit.  "
"9221",1994,"Mandela","The Government will also address all other matters that relate the creation of an attractive investment climate for both domestic and foreign investors, conscious of the fact that we have to compete with the rest of the world in terms of attracting, in particular, foreign direct investment.  "
"9222",1994,"Mandela","I am pleased that we have already started to address the important question of our trade policy, guided by our GATT commitments and the determination systematically to open the economy to global competition in a carefully managed process.  "
"9223",1994,"Mandela","Soon we will also begin trade negotiations with, among others, the European Union, the United States, our partners in the Southern African Customs Unions and our neighbours in the Southern African Development Community to provide a stable and mutually beneficial framework for our international economic relations.  "
"9224",1994,"Mandela","We will also be looking very closely at the question of enhancing South-South cooperation in general as part of the effort to expand our economic links with the rest of the world.  "
"9225",1994,"Mandela","Consistent with our objective of creating a people-centred society and effectively to address the critical questions of growth, reconstruction and development, we will, together with organised labour and the private sector, pay special attention to the issue of human resource development.  "
"9226",1994,"Mandela","Both the public and the private sectors will be encouraged to regard labour as a resource and not a cost. "
"9227",1994,"Mandela","Education and training must therefore be looked at very closely to ensure that we empower the workers, raise productivity levels and meet the skills needs of a modern economy.  "
"9228",1994,"Mandela","Important work will have to be done in and significant resources devoted to the areas of science and technology, including research and development.  "
"9229",1994,"Mandela","Government is also convinced that organised labour is an important partner whose cooperation is crucial for the reconstruction and development of our country.  "
"9230",1994,"Mandela","That partnership requires, among other things, that our labour law be reformed so that it is in line with international standards, apartheid vestiges are removed and a more harmonious labour relations dispensation is created, on the basis of tripartite cooperation between government, labour and capital.  "
"9231",1994,"Mandela","The Government is determined forcefully to confront the scourge of unemployment, not by way of handouts but by the creation of work opportunities.  "
"9232",1994,"Mandela","The Government will also deal sensitively with the issue of population movements into the country, to protect our workers, to guard against the exploitation of vulnerable workers and to ensure friendly relations with all countries and peoples.  "
"9233",1994,"Mandela","The Government is also taking urgent measures to deal firmly with drug trafficking some of which is carried out by foreign nationals who are resident in the country.  "
"9234",1994,"Mandela","We must end racism in the workplace as part of our common offensive against racism in general. "
"9235",1994,"Mandela","No more should words like Kaffirs, Hottentots, Coolies, Boy, Girl and Baas be part of our vocabulary.  "
"9236",1994,"Mandela","I also trust that the matter of paying the workers for the public holidays proclaimed in order to ensure their participation in the elections and the inauguration ceremonies will now be resolved as a result of recent consultations.  "
"9237",1994,"Mandela","This would be a welcome demonstration by the private sector of its involvement in the beautiful future we are all trying to build.  "
"9238",1994,"Mandela","We have devoted time to a discussion of economic questions because they are fundamental to the realisation of the fundamental objectives of the reconstruction and development programme.  "
"9239",1994,"Mandela","Below I mention some of the work in which the relevant governments are already involved to translate these objectives into reality.  "
"9240",1994,"Mandela","The Government will take steps to ensure the provision of clean water on the basis of the principle of water security for all and the introduction of proper sanitation sensitive to the protection of the environment.  "
"9241",1994,"Mandela","We are determined to address the dire housing shortage in a vigorous manner, acting together with the private sector and the communities in need of shelter.  "
"9242",1994,"Mandela","Health also remains a fundamental building block of the humane society we are determined to create through the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.  "
"9243",1994,"Mandela","We must address the needs of the aged and disabled, uplift disadvantaged sectors such as the women and the youth, and improve the lives of our people in the rural communities and the informal settlements.  "
"9244",1994,"Mandela","We must invest substantial amounts in education and training and meet our commitment to introduce free and compulsory education for a period of at least 9 years. "
"9245",1994,"Mandela","Everywhere we must reinculcate the culture of learning and of teaching and make it possible for this culture to thrive.  "
"9246",1994,"Mandela","We must combat such social pathologies as widespread poverty, the break down of family life, crime, alcohol and drug abuse, the abuse of children, women and the elderly and the painful reality of street children. "
"9247",1994,"Mandela","We are giving urgent attention to the long waiting lists for the payment of social grants which have developed in some areas, owing to lack of funds.  "
"9248",1994,"Mandela","I am especially pleased that we have a ministry dedicated to the issue of the environment. "
"9249",1994,"Mandela","Its work must impact on many aspects of national activity and address the question of the well-being of society as a whole and the preservation of a healthy environmental future even for generation not yet born.  "
"9250",1994,"Mandela","As we began this address, we borrowed the words of Ingrid Jonker to focus on the plight of the children our country.  "
"9251",1994,"Mandela","I would now like to say that the Government will, as a matter of urgency, attend to the tragic and complex question of children and juveniles in detention and prison.  "
"9252",1994,"Mandela","The basic principle from which we will proceed from now onwards is that we must rescue the children of the nation and ensure that the system of criminal justice must be the very last resort in the case of juvenile offenders.  "
"9253",1994,"Mandela","I have therefore issued instruction to the Departments concerned, as a matter of urgency, to work out the necessary guidelines which will enable us to empty our prisons of children and to place them in suitable alternative care. "
"9254",1994,"Mandela","This is in addition to an amnesty for various categories serving prisoners as will be effected in terms of what I said in my Inauguration Address two week ago.  "
"9255",1994,"Mandela","In this context, I also need to make the point that the Government will also not delay unduly with regard to attending to the vexed and unresolved issue of an amnesty for criminal activities carried out in furtherance of political objectives.  "
"9256",1994,"Mandela","We will attend to this matter in a balanced and dignified way. "
"9257",1994,"Mandela","The nation must come to terms with its past in a spirit of openness and forgiveness and proceed to build the future on the basis of repairing and healing.  "
"9258",1994,"Mandela","The burden of the past lies heavily on all of us, including those responsible for inflicting injury and those who suffered.  "
"9259",1994,"Mandela","Following the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, we will prepare the legislation which will seek to free the wrongdoers from fear of retribution and blackmail, while acknowledging the injury of those who have been harmed so that the individual wrongs, injuries, fears and hopes affecting individuals are identified and attended to.  "
"9260",1994,"Mandela","In the meantime, summoning the full authority of the position represent, we call on all concerned not to take any steps that might, in any way, impede or compromise the processes of reconciliation which the impending legislation will address.  "
"9261",1994,"Mandela","The problem of politically motivated violence is still with us. "
"9262",1994,"Mandela","We depend on our country's security forces to deal with this problem using all resources at their disposal. "
"9263",1994,"Mandela","In this, and in their efforts to deal especially criminal violence, they have our personal support and confidence.  "
"9264",1994,"Mandela","We have also directed that all relevant ministries should engage the structures set up in terms of the National Peace Accord so that these can be invigorated to pursue their noble mission in the context of the changed circumstances in our country.  "
"9265",1994,"Mandela","The Government will otherwise not spare any effort in ensuring that our security forces enjoy the standing they deserve of being accepted by all our people the defenders of our sovereignty, our democratic system, the guarantors of a just peace within the country and the safety and security of all citizens and their property. "
"9266",1994,"Mandela","Let met also take this opportunity to reiterate our assurance to the rest of the public service that the Government is firmly committed to the protection of the rights of all members of this service.  "
"9267",1994,"Mandela","We are also determined to work with the organisations of the service to ensure that we have the democratic, non-racial, non-sexist, honest and accountable corps of public servants which members of the Public Service themselves desire.  "
"9268",1994,"Mandela","In this context, we must also make the observation that the Government will not waver from the principle of achieving parity in remuneration and conditions of service among all workers in the public sector.  "
"9269",1994,"Mandela","The youth of our country are the valued possession of the nation. "
"9270",1994,"Mandela","Without them there can be no future. "
"9271",1994,"Mandela","Their needs are immense and urgent. "
"9272",1994,"Mandela","They are at the centre of our reconstruction and development plan.  "
"9273",1994,"Mandela","To address them, acting with the youth themselves, the Government will engage the representative organisations of the youth and other formations, among other things to look at the siting of a broad-based National Commission on Youth Development among the structures of Government.  "
"9274",1994,"Mandela","Building on this base, the Government and the Commission would then work together to ensure that the nurturing of our youth stands at the centre of our reconstruction and development, without being consigned to a meaningless ghetto of public life.  "
"9275",1994,"Mandela","Similar considerations must attach to the equally important question of the emancipation of the women of our country.  "
"9276",1994,"Mandela","It is vitally important that all structures of Government, including the President himself, should understand this fully that freedom cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.  "
"9277",1994,"Mandela","All of us must take this on board that the objectives of the Reconstruction and Development Programme will not have been realised unless we see in visible and practical terms that the condition of the women of our country has radically changed for the better and that they have been empowered to intervene in all aspects of life as equals with any other member of society.  "
"9278",1994,"Mandela","In addition to the establishment of the statutory Gender Commission provided for in the Constitution, the Government will, together with the representatives of the women themselves, look at the establishment of organs of Government to ensure that all levels of the public sector, from top to bottom, integrate the central issue of the emancipation of women in their programmes and daily activities.  "
"9279",1994,"Mandela","Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the dream of Ingrid Jonker will come to fruition. "
"9280",1994,"Mandela","The child grown to a man will trek through all Africa. "
"9281",1994,"Mandela","The child grown to a journey will journey over the whole world - without a pass!  "
"9282",1994,"Mandela","Tomorrow, on Africa Day, our new flag will be hoisted in an historic ceremony at the OAU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, with the OAU having already agreed to accept us as its latest member.  "
"9283",1994,"Mandela","Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the UN Security Council will meet to lift the last remaining sanctions against South Africa and to position the world organisation to relate to our country as an honoured, responsible and peace-loving citizen.  "
"9284",1994,"Mandela","As such, the Government is involved in discussion to determine what our contribution could be to the search for peace in Angola and Rwanda, to the reinforcement of the peace process in Mozambique, to the establishment of a new world order of mutually beneficial cooperation, justice, prosperity and peace for ourselves and for the nations of the world.  "
"9285",1994,"Mandela","Yesterday the Cabinet also decided to apply for our country to join the Commonwealth. "
"9286",1994,"Mandela","This important community of nations is waiting to receive us with open arms.  "
"9287",1994,"Mandela","We have learnt the lesson that our blemishes speak of what all humanity should not do. "
"9288",1994,"Mandela","We understand this fully that our glories point to the heights of what human genius can achieve.  "
"9289",1994,"Mandela","In our dreams we have a vision of all our country at play in our sportsfields and enjoying deserved and enriching recreation in our theatres, galleries, beaches, mountains, plains and game parks, in conditions of peace, security and comfort.  "
"9290",1994,"Mandela","Our road to that glorious future lies through collective hard work to accomplish the objective of creating a people-centred society through the implementation of the vision contained in our reconstruction and development plan.  "
"9291",1994,"Mandela","Let us all get down to work!"
"9292",1994,"deKlerk"," Mr Speaker  This Parliament has convened to adopt important amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 1993.  "
"9293",1994,"deKlerk","The fact that we have done so in the midst of the most crucial election campaign of our national history speaks for itself. "
"9294",1994,"deKlerk","It is an indication of the importance which we attach to ensuring that the coming election is as inclusive as possible.  "
"9295",1994,"deKlerk","If we wish to have a peaceful and stable future, it is of the greatest importance that as many of our people and parties as possible should participate in this historical process.  "
"9296",1994,"deKlerk","It is essential that no-one and no party should be able to claim that they are excluded or that their reasonable concerns have not been accommodated in the Transitional Constitution.  "
"9297",1994,"deKlerk","It was to this end that the Government, the National Party and other participating parties have gone out of their way, particularly during the past weeks, to accommodate the concerns raised by the parties of the Freedom Alliance.  "
"9298",1994,"deKlerk","The concerns of the Freedom Alliance, as distilled from weeks of hard negotiations, included the following:  The Freedom Alliance said they wanted stronger assurances relating to the autonomy of provinces with regard to their powers, functions and boundaries.  "
"9299",1994,"deKlerk","The amendment of section 126 of the Constitution deletes the reference to concurrency. "
"9300",1994,"deKlerk","Thus it is made absolutely clear that laws passed by the provincial legislatures will in general prevail over laws passed by the national parliament on matters reserved for the provinces. "
"9301",1994,"deKlerk","Only in exceptional circumstances, specifically provided for, will the position be different.  "
"9302",1994,"deKlerk","The freedom Alliance was particularly concerned that a future Government might try to diminish the powers of the provinces in the final constitution.  "
"9303",1994,"deKlerk","The amendment of constitutional Principle XVIII provides that the powers and functions of provinces will not be substantially diminished in the final constitution. "
"9304",1994,"deKlerk","There are those who read something sinister in the word ""substantially"". "
"9305",1994,"deKlerk","However, I am assured that it is a technical provision, which cannot be misused to undermine the scope of provincial powers or autonomy in any meaningful way. "
"9306",1994,"deKlerk","It is there merely to provide for some minor changes which might to agreed upon.  "
"9307",1994,"deKlerk","The provincial provision, according to the Freedom Alliance. "
"9308",1994,"deKlerk","It must also be recalled that no constitutional principle can be changed after the election, even by a 100 % majority in Parliament.  "
"9309",1994,"deKlerk","The Freedom Alliance wanted the Provisions to have greater fiscal and financial autonomy.  "
"9310",1994,"deKlerk","The amendment of sections 155-159 of the Constitution will strengthen the taxing competence of the provinces, and goes a long way in meeting the requirements of the Freedom Alliance.  "
"9311",1994,"deKlerk","The Freedom Alliance asked for greater powers for the provinces in drawing up their own Constitutions.  "
"9312",1994,"deKlerk","The amendment of section 160 of the Constitution will enable provincial legislatures to include specific provisions in their own constitutions regarding their own legislative and executive structures. "
"9313",1994,"deKlerk","This will allow provinces to legislate for their unique requirements. "
"9314",1994,"deKlerk","It will, for example, enable the province of KwaZulu/Natal to make special provision for the Zulu monarchy. "
"9315",1994,"deKlerk","Simultaneously it creates room for asymmetry between provinces.  "
"9316",1994,"deKlerk","The Freedom Alliance wanted the name of Natal to be changed to KwaZulu/Natal.  "
"9317",1994,"deKlerk","The proposed amendments to the Transitional Constitution will make this possible.  "
"9318",1994,"deKlerk","Another major concern of the Freedom Alliance was that there should be two separate ballots in the election, one for the national parliament and one for the provincial legislatures.  "
"9319",1994,"deKlerk","This will be achieved by amendments to the Electoral Act - which will be amended to extend the deadline for parties to register for the election until 4 March 1994.  "
"9320",1994,"deKlerk","Another principal concern of the Freedom Alliance - and particularly of the Afrikaner Volksfront - is its demand for self-determination within a ""Volkstaat"".  "
"9321",1994,"deKlerk","Even this concern will be addressed in t he proposed constitutional amendments. "
"9322",1994,"deKlerk","A new constitutional principle will be added on the subject of self-determination - including the possibility that it might be exercised in a territorial entity, if constitutionally agreed. "
"9323",1994,"deKlerk","Provision is also made by amending Chapter 11 to create a mechanism for conducting further negotiations of the subject of a Volkstaat for those who really want it.  "
"9324",1994,"deKlerk","The Government believes that it and the other negotiating parties have now done everything within reason to address the main concerns of the Freedom Alliance.  "
"9325",1994,"deKlerk","The fact is that the Transitional Constitution will bring into being provinces with genuine autonomous powers, based on federal principles.  "
"9326",1994,"deKlerk","Those powers are strongly entrenched and cannot be arbitrarily diminished by the central government in terms of either the Transitional Constitution or the final constitution.  "
"9327",1994,"deKlerk","Voters will have a double ballot as requested by the Freedom Alliance parties.  "
"9328",1994,"deKlerk","Provinces will have extended and independent taxation powers.  "
"9329",1994,"deKlerk","Their powers have been further extended and clarified and they will be able to adopt their own constitutions.  "
"9330",1994,"deKlerk","* The Province of Natal will be known as KwaZulu-Natal as requested.  "
"9331",1994,"deKlerk","* The door has been opened to continued negotiation around the concept of a ""Volkstaat"".  "
"9332",1994,"deKlerk","There can now no longer be any reasonable excuse for non-participation in the elections and in the continuing national constitutional process.  "
"9333",1994,"deKlerk","We will achieve these improvements to the Transitional Constitution by adopting amendments in this Parliament.  "
"9334",1994,"deKlerk","However, I have for some time had a suspicion that the Freedom Alliance's main difficulty has not been so much with the text of the Constitution, but with the broader realities of our time.  "
"9335",1994,"deKlerk","This Parliament can amend the Transitional Constitution - but it cannot amend reality:  * It cannot amend the reality that the Afrikaners are in a minority in all the recognised and historical regions of South Africa.  "
"9336",1994,"deKlerk","* It cannot amend the reality that all South Africans are inextricably interdependent - economically, socially and constitutionally.  "
"9337",1994,"deKlerk","* It cannot and should not amend the reality that all South Africans have a right to participate in the processes of Government, without being subjected to any form of discrimination.  "
"9338",1994,"deKlerk","Parties may continue to boycott the constitutional process, but ultimately they will not be able to avoid these realities.  "
"9339",1994,"deKlerk","By boycotting the elections they will wastefully exclude themselves and their followers from making their full contribution tot he constitutional future of South Africa and to the peaceful promotion of their own values and ideals.  "
"9340",1994,"deKlerk","However, non-participation - though regrettable and wasteful - is a legitimate option. "
"9341",1994,"deKlerk","If parties choose this route it is their right to do so.  "
"9342",1994,"deKlerk","I must, however, stress that whether they decide to participate in the process or not, we are determined to proceed with the elections on 26-28 April and with the implementation of the Transitional Constitution.  "
"9343",1994,"deKlerk","* We dare not allow any minority to deprive the great majority South Africans of their long-awaited desire to elect national and provincial governments which will for the first time in our history be truly representative of all South Africans.  "
"9344",1994,"deKlerk","* We dare not allow anyone to stand in the way of the rapid economic growth and development which can come about only through a constitutional settlement which enjoys internal and external legitimacy.  "
"9345",1994,"deKlerk","* We will not allow anyone to deprive South Africans of the hard-won and painstakingly negotiated rights which are now entrenched in the our constitutional system.  "
"9346",1994,"deKlerk","As I have said, it is the right of any party to boycott the elections.  "
"9347",1994,"deKlerk","It is also the right of any party to continue to pursue its objectives by peaceful and constitutional means.  "
"9348",1994,"deKlerk","* However, I will strenuously oppose any attempt by any party to prevent any South African citizen from exercising his or her right to participate in the election.  "
"9349",1994,"deKlerk","* The Government will not tolerate any attempt by any party to disrupt the election.  "
"9350",1994,"deKlerk","* The Government will use all the means at its disposal, including the security forces, to deal with any party which might seek to achieve its objectives through violence or through unconstitutional, illegal or undemocratic means.  "
"9351",1994,"deKlerk","Parties which contemplate secession or the illegal seizure of state or municipal power should have no illusions concerning their position or the consequences of their actions:  * They should have no illusion concerning their support. "
"9352",1994,"deKlerk","They constitute a minority of the total South African population and within each province. "
"9353",1994,"deKlerk","If they disagree with this contention, participation in the election would be the best way of proving their real support.  "
"9354",1994,"deKlerk","* The Afrikaner Volksfront has no right to claim to speak on behalf of the Afrikaans people. "
"9355",1994,"deKlerk","The represent only a faction, and as it is, a divided faction. "
"9356",1994,"deKlerk","The vast majority of Afrikaners are decent, peace-loving and sensible people who dearly with to find a peaceful and workable modus vivendi with the other peoples of South Africa. "
"9357",1994,"deKlerk","They have no wish to become involved in a futile and meaningless war against their brother Afrikaners. "
"9358",1994,"deKlerk","They have no interest in losing their jobs, their homes and everything they own in pursuit of a hopeless illusion.  "
"9359",1994,"deKlerk","* They should have no illusions that they will receive any international support.  "
"9360",1994,"deKlerk","There is no way that the international community ever would, or ever could, accept a state based once again on minority racial domination and racial discrimination. "
"9361",1994,"deKlerk","There can be no return to apartheid. "
"9362",1994,"deKlerk","And any effort in that direction will end in conflict, total isolation and utter and complete economic ruin.  "
"9363",1994,"deKlerk","* Neither should he parties involved have any illusion with regard to the role of the security forces. "
"9364",1994,"deKlerk","The South African Defence Force and the South African Police are highly professional and dedicated forces. "
"9365",1994,"deKlerk","They have a long and proud tradition of loyal service to the Government of the day. "
"9366",1994,"deKlerk","They have a key role to play in upholding the integrity of the new state and of our constitution and they will play that role.  "
"9367",1994,"deKlerk","There is simply no future on the road of unconstitutional and violent activity. "
"9368",1994,"deKlerk","I appeal to any of those who might be considering this road to turn back before it is too late.  "
"9369",1994,"deKlerk","I have a deep understanding for the concerns of the Zulu King and his people in respect of the future of the Zulu monarchy. "
"9370",1994,"deKlerk","We have been involved in serious and in-depth discussions about he issue.  "
"9371",1994,"deKlerk","Unfortunately we have not been able,as yet, to each specific agreements on how to address these concerns. "
"9372",1994,"deKlerk","As far as I am concerned, negotiation must continue until agreement is achieved.  "
"9373",1994,"deKlerk","There should, however, be no doubts as to where I, the Government and the Party which I lead, stand in this regard.  "
"9374",1994,"deKlerk","* The Zulu Kingdom is recognised by us as a unique reality. "
"9375",1994,"deKlerk","It has a proud history and it plays an important role in the life of the Zulu nation.  "
"9376",1994,"deKlerk","* We support the principle that the Zulu Kingdom must receive constitutional recognition, also through effective Constitutional Safeguards your voice heard. "
"9377",1994,"deKlerk","The best defence against the abuse of your rights will be ensure that the new Parliament as is balanced as possible - that no party emerges with too much power.  "
"9378",1994,"deKlerk","* If you wish to oppose those with whom you strongly disagree, do so within the framework provided by the Transitional Constitution - and not through self-destructive involvement in violent and unconstitutional actions.  "
"9379",1994,"deKlerk","* If you have concerns, or if you feel threatened, seek protection from the institutions which the new constitution creates.  "
"9380",1994,"deKlerk","Remember that the process of constitutional development will not end with the election of the new Parliament. "
"9381",1994,"deKlerk","One of its most important tasks will be to draw up a final Constitution. "
"9382",1994,"deKlerk","Constitutional negotiations will accordingly continue within the new Parliament and all parties in the National Assembly will be able to promote their interests and objectives in the ongoing constitutional debate.  "
